# Jenkins X Docs

Documentation site for [Jenkins X](http://jenkins-x.io/)

**Please browse these docs** on the [http://jenkins-x.io/](http://jenkins-x.io/) site as the links don't all work when browsing the markdown files inside github 


## Build the docs locally

To edit the docs locally and try out what the [website](http://jenkins-x.io/) will look like then you need to clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-docs.git
```

Then to view the docs in your browser, [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).
Navigate to the directory, run hugo server, and open up the link:

```bash
$ cd jx-docs
$ hugo server
