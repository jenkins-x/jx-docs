The Jenkins X Community is like no other, we are friendly, very open to feedback, provide guidance, best practices and much more.  You can find us in various channels.

Please join us, we'd love to hear your feedback or have you participate and show some of the work you are doing with Jenkins X!

## Slack

The Kubernetes community [hangs out on Slack](http://slack.k8s.io/) at [kubernetes.slack.com](https://kubernetes.slack.com/) so we have rooms there to chat about all things Jenkins X:

* [\#jenkins-x-user](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C9MBGQJRH) for users of Jenkins X
* [\#jenkins-x-dev](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/C9LTHT2BB) for developers of Jenkins X

If you do not already have an account created for the `kubernetes` workspace you can create one by clicking [`GET MY INVITE`](http://slack.k8s.io/)
