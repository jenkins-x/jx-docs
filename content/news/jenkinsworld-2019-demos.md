During lunch hours we are scheduling the following demo briefs at the Jenkins and Jenkins X Community Booth:

**Wednesday  August 14, 2019**

**12:10 - 12:25pm Faster Git [Mark Waite](https://github.com/MarkEWaite)**

Attendees will learn the techniques they can use with Jenkins to make their systems clone and update git repositories faster and with less disc space.

**12:25 - 12:40pm	Observability in Jenkins X	[Oscar Medina](https://github.com/sharepointoscar)**

If you are using Jenkins X, you’re already building at rapid pace.  However, most miss the opportunity to gain real insights into their build and release pipeline.  I'll show you how you can increase observability by activating metric capture and analysis during a containerized application deployment with Jenkins X.  This  entails modifying the declarative Tekton pipelines.

**12:40 - 12:55pm	Jenkins-Rest, A JClouds Java Library for the Jenkins REST API	[Martin d'Anjou](https://github.com/martinda)**

Using the Java-Rest library, we demonstrate how to submit a job to Jenkins, and track it to its completion, all from the command line, without ever touching the GUI.

**12:55 - 1:10pm DevOps without Quality: An IT Horror Story	Laura Keaton**

DevOps, the current IT Industry sweetheart, has a dark secret that has victimized organizations on their transformational journey. Investigate two case studies that left development and delivery teams in tatters and how quality engineering solutions could have prevented their disastrous outcomes.

**1:10 - 1:25pm	Securing Your Jenkins Container Pipeline with Open Source Tools	[Christian Wiens](https://github.com/cwiens1211)**

Discuss the security pitfalls of containers and how embedding an open source image scanning and policy based compliance tool like Anchore into your CI/CD pipeline can mitigate this risk.

**Thursday  August 15, 2019**

**12:25 - 12:40pm	Results from the 2019 Jenkins Google Summer of Code	[Martin d'Anjou](https://github.com/martinda)**

In 2019, the Jenkins project participated in the Google Summer of Code. This is an annual, international, program which encourages college-aged students to participate in open source projects during the summer break between classes. In 2019, we had dozens of applications and many student projects. In this session, we will showcase the students' projects and talk about what they bring to the Jenkins ecosystem.

**12:40 - 12:55pm	Sysdig Secure Jenkins Plugin	[Marky Jackson](https://github.com/markyjackson-taulia)**

[Sysdig Secure](https://sysdig.com/products/secure) is a container security platform that brings together docker image scanning and run-time protection to identify vulnerabilities, block threats, enforce compliance, and audit activity across your microservices. The Sysdig Secure Jenkins plugin can be used in a Pipeline job, or added as a build step to a Freestyle job, to automate the process of running an image analysis, evaluating custom policies against images, and performing security scans.

**12:55 - 1:10pm	Using React for plugin UI	[Jeff Pearce](https://github.com/jeffpearce)**

The working hours plugin has a date driven UI. During this summer's Google Summer of Code, our student rewrite the UI in React, so that we could take advantage open source modules such as calendar pickers. I'll talk about how the student approached the UI, demonstrate the UI and talk about particular challenges we faces.

**1:10 - 1:25pm	Jenkins GKE Plugin [Craig Barber](https://github.com/craigdbarber)**

In this demo we will showcase the Jenkins GKE plugin, newest addition to GCP’s suite of officially supported plugins. We’ll show how to leverage this plugin to deploy applications built in Jenkins pipelines to multiple clusters running in GKE.

Grab your lunch and join us at the community theater!
