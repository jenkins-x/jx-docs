OK so you have [got the jx CLI](/getting-started/install/) and you either

* [created a Kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X](/getting-started/install-on-cluster/)
* [installed Jenkins X on an existing kubernetes cluster](/getting-started/install-on-cluster/)

So whats next?

Well the [Developing](/developing/) section contains the next steps you may want to try out, such as

* [create a new Spring Boot application and import it into Jenkins X](/developing/create-spring/) 
* [create a new quickstart and import it into Jenkins X](/developing/create-quickstart/)
* [import existing source code into Jenkins X](/developing/import/)
* [browsing](/developing/browsing/) for browsing pipelines, builds, apps and activity
