We are thrilled to announce that Jenkins X will be joining the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation/) as one of the founding projects.  The Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) is a brand new sub-foundation of the Linux Foundation and will be dedicated to advancing the practice of continuous delivery and nurturing an ecosystem of interoperable tools for software delivery.

Jenkins X is just over [a year old](/news/happy-first-birthday/) but has been growing rapidly as the CI/CD solution for modern cloud applications on Kubernetes. Jenkins X automates CI+CD for Kubernetes using the best of breed OSS tools such as Jenkins, Tekton, Prow, Skaffold, Kaniko and Helm. The CDF will be a sibling foundation to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) which hosts Kubernetes amongst others. CDF will have its first event, CDF Summit, on May 20th alongside KubeCon Barcelona. We always love to work closely with other communities, and this will continue at scale within the CDF.

“I’m really excited to see the formation of the CDF - it's starting with some of the most popular best-of-breed open source tools in the CI/CD space," said James Strachan, co-founder of Jenkins X and distinguished engineer, CloudBees. "I’m looking forward to increased collaboration between us all to help accelerate the open source CI/CD landscape.”

Jenkins X started life under the Jenkins umbrella. In CDF, Jenkins X will be a distinct project from Jenkins which means some changes, such as having a Jenkins X Technical Steering Committee. These changes will happen gradually as we transition to CDF over the coming weeks. Normal development work will continue as usual.

We are excited about all the new possibilities that being part of the CDF will bring. We look forward to new initiatives and welcoming everybody to [get involved with the project](/contribute/).
