## jx step post install

Runs any post install actions

### Synopsis

This pipeline step ensures that all the necessary jobs are imported and the webhooks set up - e.g. for the current Environments. 

It is designed to work with GitOps based development environments where the permanent Environments like Staging and Production are defined in a git repository. This step is used to ensure that all the 'Environment' resources have their associated CI+CD jobs setup in Jenkins or Prow with the necessary webhooks in place.
