## jx step unstash

Unstashes files generated as part of a pipeline to a local file or directory or displays on the console

### Synopsis

This pipeline step unstashes the files in storage to a local file or the console
  
Currently Jenkins X supports storing files into a branch of a git repository or in cloud blob storage like S3, GCS, Azure blobs etc. 

When using Cloud Storage we use URLs like 's3://nameOfBucket' on AWS, 'gs://anotherBucket' on GCP or on Azure 'azblob://thatBucket'
