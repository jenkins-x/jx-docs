## jx step git fork-and-clone

Forks and clones a git repo

### Synopsis

This pipeline step will clone a git repo, creating a fork if required. The fork is created if the owner of the repo is not the current git user (and that forking the git repo is allowed).

```
jx step git fork-and-clone [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Fork and clone the jx repo
  jx step git fork-and-clone https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx.git
  
  # Duplicate and clone the jx repo. This will create a new repo and mirror the contents of the source repo into,
  # but it won't mark it as a fork in the git provider
  jx step git fork-and-clone https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx.git --duplicate
```

### Options

```
      --base string     The base ref to start from (default "master")
      --dir string      The directory in which the git repo is checked out, by default the working directory
  -h, --help            help for fork-and-clone
      --print-out-dir   prints the directory the fork has been cloned to on stdout
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -b, --batch-mode   Runs in batch mode without prompting for user input (default true)
      --verbose      Enables verbose output
```
