## jx gc helm

garbage collection for Helm ConfigMaps

### Synopsis

Garbage collect Helm ConfigMaps.  To facilitate rollbacks, Helm leaves a history of chart versions in place in Kubernetes and these should be pruned at intervals to avoid consuming excessive system resources.

```
jx gc helm [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  jx garbage collect helm
  jx gc helm
```

### Options

```
  -b, --batch-mode                   In batch mode the command never prompts for user input
      --dry-run                      Does not perform the delete operation on Kubernetes
      --headless                     Enable headless operation if using browser automation
  -h, --help                         help for helm
      --no-backup                    Does not perform the backup operation to store files locally
      --no-brew                      Disables the use of brew on MacOS to install or upgrade command line dependencies
  -o, --output-dir string            Relative directory to output backup to. Defaults to ./configmaps (default "configmaps")
