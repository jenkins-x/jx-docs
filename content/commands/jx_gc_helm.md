## jx gc helm

garbage collection for Helm ConfigMaps

### Synopsis

Garbage collect Helm ConfigMaps.  To facilitate rollbacks, Helm leaves a history of chart versions in place in Kubernetes and these should be pruned at intervals to avoid consuming excessive system resources.

```
jx gc helm [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  jx garbage collect helm
  jx gc helm
```

### Options

```
  -b, --batch-mode                   In batch mode the command never prompts for user input
      --dry-run                      Does not perform the delete operation on Kubernetes
      --headless                     Enable headless operation if using browser automation
  -h, --help                         help for helm
      --install-dependencies         Should any required dependencies be installed automatically
      --log-level string             Logging level. Possible values - panic, fatal, error, warning, info, debug. (default "info")
      --no-backup                    Does not perform the backup operation to store files locally

  -o, --output-dir string            Relative directory to output backup to. Defaults to ./configmaps (default "configmaps")
      --pull-secrets string          The pull secrets the service account created should have (useful when deploying to your own private registry): provide multiple pull secrets by providing them in a singular block of quotes e.g. --pull-secrets "foo, bar, baz"
      --revision-history-limit int   Minimum number of versions per release to keep (default 10)
      --skip-auth-secrets-merge      Skips merging a local git auth yaml file with any pipeline secrets that are found
