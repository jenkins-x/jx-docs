## jx step envrolebinding

Mirrors EnvironmentRoleBinding resources to Roles and RoleBindings in all matching Environment namespaces

### Synopsis

Mirrors EnvironmentRoleBinding resources to Roles and RoleBindings in all matching Environment namespaces. 

RBAC in Kubernetes is either global with ClusterRoles or is namespace based with Roles per Namespace. 

We use a Custom Resource called EnvironmentRoleBinding which binds Roles and its bindings from the development environment into each Environment's Namespace. 

e.g. each EnvironmentRoleBinding will result in a RoleBinding and Role resource being create in each matching Environment. So when a Preview environment is created it will have the correct Role and RoleBinding resources added.

```
jx step envrolebinding [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # update the current RoleBinding resources in each environment based on the current EnvironmentRoleBindings
  jx step envrolebinding
  
  # watch for changes in Environments and EnvironmentRoleBindings
  # and update the RoleBinding resources in each environment namespace
  jx step envrolebinding -w
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help    help for envrolebinding
  -w, --watch   Whether to watch the Environments and EnvironmentRoleBindings for changes
```
