## jx completion

Output shell completion code for the given shell (bash or zsh)

### Synopsis

Output shell completion code for the given shell (bash or zsh). 

This command prints shell code which must be evaluation to provide interactive completion of jx commands. 

  $ source <(jx completion bash)
  
will load the jx completion code for bash. Note that this depends on the bash-completion framework. It must be sourced before sourcing the jx completion, e.g. on the Mac: 

  $ brew install bash-completion
  $ source $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion
  $ source <(jx completion bash)
  
On a Mac it often works better to generate a file with the completion and source that: 

  $ jx completion bash > ~/.jx/bash
  $ source ~/.jx/bash
  
If you use zsh [1], the following will load jx zsh completion: 

  $ source <(jx completion zsh)
  
 [1] zsh completions are only supported in versions of zsh >= 5.2

```
jx completion SHELL [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for completion
```
