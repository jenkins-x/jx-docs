  -b, --batch-mode                In batch mode the command never prompts for user input
      --context string            The kube context to uninstall JX from. This will be compared with the current context to prevent accidental uninstallation from the wrong cluster

  -h, --help                      help for uninstall

      --pull-secrets string       The pull secrets the service account created should have (useful when deploying to your own private registry): provide multiple pull secrets by providing them in a singular block of quotes e.g. --pull-secrets "foo, bar, baz"
      --skip-auth-secrets-merge   Skips merging a local git auth yaml file with any pipeline secrets that are found
