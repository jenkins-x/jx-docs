  jx step patch-config -m config --first-level-property config.yaml -p '["op": "replace", "path": "/plank", "value": {"foo": "bar"}]'
  
  # Update a root level property of a config map using strategic merge:
  jx step patch-config -m config -t strategic -p '{"metadata": {"initializers": {"result": {"status": "newstatus"}}}}'
```
