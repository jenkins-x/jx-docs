We want to enable the Jenkins X open source community to move fast, innovate and iterate while at the same time keeping stability.

So we innovate within the Labs so that we can go quickly and innovate rapidly then when things are stable we can roll them into the stable Jenkins X release.

For more details see the [Labs Enhancements proposal](https://github.com/rawlingsj/enhancements/blob/master/proposals/labs/README.md).
