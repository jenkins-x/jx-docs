The repository [jenkins-x/enhancements](https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements) contains design proposals for Jenkins X.

All proposals are welcome, please follow this process:

- Raise an issue on this repository describing at high level what the enhancement looks to achieve and whether you would like any help with the proposal.
- If you would like some early collaboration from the Jenkins X community you might want to start with Google Docs for a faster feedback cycle.
- Open a pull request containing markdown giving some context, describing the problem the enhancement aims to solve along with possible solutions.
