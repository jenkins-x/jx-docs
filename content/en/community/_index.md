The Jenkins X Community is like no other, we are friendly, very open to feedback, provide guidance, best practices and much more. 

Join us on [Slack](/community/#slack) or during [Office Hours](/community/#office-hours) to ask questions and tell us what you are building.
Upcoming [events and webinars](/community/#events--webinars) are shown on our [Event Calendar](/community/calendar) or announced on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jenkinsxio).

We value respect and inclusiveness and follow the [CDF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cdfoundation/toc/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all interactions.
