The Jenkins X roadmap will be updated approximately once a month. 
Please join our [office hours](https://jenkins-x.io/community/#office-hours) and [Slack channels](https://jenkins-x.io/community/#slack) to ask questions and drive input on the future of the project!

Please note that the [Current Work](/community/roadmap/#current-work) is being done in Jenkins X 2 and that most of the listed [Near Term](/community/roadmap/#near-term-work) and [Future Work](/community/roadmap/#future-work) are proposals that are being discussed in the [Jenkins X enhancements repo](https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements) and will likely form the basis of Jenkins X 3. Some of the proposed enhancements will land in Jenkins X 2 as well, but the focus for future work is on Jenkins X 3.

## Current Work

- [Bring your own vault](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/install-setup/installing/boot/secrets/#external)

## Near Term Work

- [Integrate with Tekton catalog](https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements/issues/37)
- Major component pluggability

- [Technical debt reduction / Improved architecture](https://github.com/jenkins-x/enhancements/pull/31)
