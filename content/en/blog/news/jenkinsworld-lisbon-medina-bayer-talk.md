In today’s technology landscape, people find it difficult to get up to speed with technologies for many reasons.  One reason that comes to mind is time.  Another may be that  some folks are just not able to read a tutorial or blog post and be successful at ramping up with a specific technology.  

So these individuals need either a bootcamp or to sit and watch live demos and have someone explain concepts.  It is for these reasons that Oscar and Andrew [will be introducing Jenkins X](https://sched.co/VFHj) to people that might have heard of it, but have not yet had a chance to play with it.

Folks will be introduced to Jenkins X with simplicity in mind.  The speakers will walk through all the concepts of the platform. To make things fun, and easier to follow - the speakers plan to carry out the session in the form of a skit in which one speaker is an IT person from a fictitious company, and the other is the Jenkins X Expert.

You will not want to miss this session if you are considering using a Kubernetes native CI/CD that abstracts you from the complexities of Kubernetes.

On December 4, 2019, [Andrew Bayer](https://twitter.com/abayer) and I, [@sharePointOscar](https://twitter.com/SharePointOscar) will be speaking more on this topic at DevOps World | Jenkins World Lisbon.
