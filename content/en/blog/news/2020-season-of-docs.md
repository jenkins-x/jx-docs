[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) fosters collaboration between open source projects and technical writers. This program brings the open source and technical writing communities together to improve documentation and increase awareness of open source. During the program, technical writers are given support in contributing to open source, information about the technical project to which they are contributing, and a stipend. 

Jenkins X welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with technical writers on improving the Jenkins X documentation. We are excited to apply to participate in Google Season of Docs!

### Project Ideas

Jenkins X invites technical writers to engage with our ongoing efforts to restructure and update the Jenkins X documentation. There are a number of ongoing projects, and technical writers are welcome to engage with them or to make their own proposals in any area of Jenkins X documentation. We welcome the experience and perspecitve of new contributors and encourage proposals based on a technical writer's interests and expertise. 

* Refactor the open source project's existing documentation to provide an improved user experience or a more accessible information architecture.
* Write a conceptual overview of, or introduction to, a product or feature. Often a team creates their technical documentation from the bottom up, with the result that there's a lot of detail but it's hard to understand the product as a whole. A technical writer can fix this.
* Create a tutorial for a high-profile use case.
* Create a set of focused how-to guides for specific tasks.
* Create a contributor’s guide that includes basic information about getting started as a contributor to the open source project, as well as any rules around licence agreements, processes for pull requests and reviews, building the project, and so on. 

The main part of Season of Docs runs for three months, from September to December 2020, but the application period for technical writers ends on July 9, 2020. [Detailed GSoD Timeline can be found here](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline).
