[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) fosters collaboration between open source projects and technical writers. This program brings the open source and technical writing communities together to improve documentation and increase awareness of open source. During the program, technical writers are given support in contributing to open source, information about the technical project to which they are contributing, and a stipend.

Jenkins X welcomes the opportunity to collaborate with technical writers on improving the Jenkins X documentation. We are excited to apply to participate in Google Season of Docs!

### Project Ideas

Jenkins X invites technical writers to engage with our ongoing efforts to restructure and update the Jenkins X documentation. There are a number of ongoing projects, and technical writers are welcome to engage with them or to make their own proposals in any area of Jenkins X documentation. We welcome the experience and perspecitve of new contributors and encourage proposals based on a technical writer's interests and expertise.

* Refactor the existing documentation to provide an improved user experience or a more accessible information architecture:

    We are currently in the process of restructuring the information architecture on the docs site. We recognise this is an iterative process and would welcome input from a technical writer on further improvements to create an accessible information architecture and improve the user experience.

* Improve our [contributorâ€™s guide](/community/documentation/) to ensure the information for new contributors is clear and well organised, including basic information about getting started as a contributor to Jenkins X, as well as any rules around licence agreements, processes for pull requests and reviews, building the project, and so on.

* Create a tutorial for provisioning a Kubernetes cluster and installing Jenkins X with `jx boot` on platforms that are not covered with Terraform. Currently, the [Get started page](/docs/getting-started/) gives the incorrect impression that Jenkins X works only in GKE (Google Cloud Platform) and EKS (Amazon Web Services).

<!-- * Write a how-to guide on using the new Terraform scripts to create Kubernetes clusters. Currently, on the docs site there is a [TODO for documentation on using Terraform to set up cloud resources](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/labs/boot/getting-started/cloud/terraform/). Using Terraform scripts to create clusters makes cluster creation more transparent and can increase default security. For more information on using Terraform scripts, please see a [recent office hours demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yujge0PHxd4) by [Hardy Ferentschik](https://github.com/hferentschik). -->

* Build out [Creating Projects](/docs/getting-started/first-project/) section to include new or extended sections such as Understanding Buildpacks, New Project With Quickstart Or Import, Defining Environments, etc. The GSoD writer would work with the Jenkins X engineering team and community to build out those pages.

* Create FAQs for select docs pages. The GSoD writer would read through our [Kubernetes slack channels](/community/#slack) and [closed issues](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) to identify the most common questions we are asked and to take the answers given to build out the FAQs.
