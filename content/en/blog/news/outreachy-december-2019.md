Jenkins X is happy to announce our participation in the Outreachy program running from December 2019 to March 2020. 

Outreachy helps people from groups underrepresented in free and open source software get involved by providing "a supportive community for beginning to contribute any time throughout the year and offer focused internship opportunities twice a year with a number of free software organizations.‚Äù The internships are for three-months, during which mentees work on specific projects. 

Organisations that participate in Outreachy include Apache, CNCF Tracing, Mozilla, GNOME, the Linux Kernel, GNU Guix, Wikimedia, Debian, Git, Tekton, Jenkins, and Jenkins X. These organisations outline specific projects for the interns to work on and provide remote mentors.

Please see [Outreachy's site](https://www.outreachy.org/) for more information about the program, such as its purpose, eligibility requirements, and how to apply.

### About Jenkins X

Jenkins X is an open source, opinionated way to do continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) on Kubernetes. As such, it provides a modern, best practices approach to CI/CD for cloud native applications. 

Jenkins X aids developers in provisioning Kubernetes clusters, automates CI/CD, provides different virtual environments for development, staging, and production using Kubernetes namespaces, and provides preview environments for pull requests.

### Jenkins X projects for Outreachy

[Jenkins X has two projects for Outreachy applicants](https://www.outreachy.org/apply/project-selection/#jenkins-x) to engage with:

**Create a Cloud Storage backed Helm repository for Jenkins X, replacing ChartMuseum**

Mentor: [Hardy Ferentschik](https://twitter.com/fere0010)

As part of the Jenkins X workflow, Helm charts are created which need to be deployed and made available. This project would replace [ChartMuseum](https://chartmuseum.com/) with a cloud storage bucket to host and serve Helm charts.
