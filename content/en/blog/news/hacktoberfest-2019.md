# Hacktoberfest

Hacktoberfest is a month-long global celebration of open source software. 

From October 1 to October 31, submit four pull requests to qualify for the limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to participate in Hacktoberfest and join a global community of open source contributors.

We'd love for you to contribute to the Jenkins X project! 

All pull requests will count towards your Hacktoberfest challenge. Issues labelled "hacktoberfest" generally indicate good first issues. Jenkins X welcomes contributors to both:

* [the Jenkins X `jx` source code](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx)
* [the Jenkins X documentation website](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-docs)

### Contribute to jx

Jenkins X is an open source project and we welcome new contributors. There are plenty of [open issues](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues), and we welcome your help in making Jenkins X even more awesome. 

Jenkins X is written largely in Go, but you don't need to be an expert to contribute! If you are new to the project, search for issues labelled "good-first-issue", a number of which we've also given the ["hacktoberfest" label](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/labels/hacktoberfest). Our [Contributing Guide](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/contributing/code/) has advice for getting started with contributing to Jenkins X.

### Contribute to the docs

We welcome your help in making the Jenkins X documenation better. If you see areas of the documentation that need fixing or augmentation please raise a pull request! Our guide for [Contributing to the Documentation](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/contributing/documentation/) has advice for getting started with contributing to the Jenkins X docs.

### Ask us questions

We're happy to help if you have any questions. Talk to us on our slack channels, which are part of the Kubernetes slack. Join  Kubernetes slack [here](http://slack.k8s.io/) and find us on our channels:

* #jenkins-x-dev for developers of Jenkins X
* #jenkins-x-user for users of Jenkins X

We also have online office hours, where we talk about new developments in Jenkins X and you are welcome to ask us questions, every other Thursday at 4pm UK (BST) / 11am US Eastern / 8am US Pacific. 

Next office hours are on **3 October**. Join us here: https://zoom.us/j/397862697

### Jenkins Hacktoberfest
