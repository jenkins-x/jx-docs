We are excited to announce that Jenkins X will be participating in Hacktoberfest again this year! Hacktoberfest is a month-long global celebration of open source software.

From October 1 to October 31, submit four pull requests to qualify for the limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to participate in Hacktoberfest and join a global community of open source contributors.

### Contribute to Jenkins X

We welcome your contributions to the Jenkins X project!

[Issues labelled "hacktoberfest"](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-docs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+hacktoberfest) generally indicate good first issues. However, all pull requests will count towards your Hacktoberfest challenge. Jenkins X welcomes contributors to both:

* [the Jenkins X `jx` source code](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx)
* [the Jenkins X documentation website](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-docs)

### Contribute to `jx` source code

There are plenty of [open issues](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx/issues), and we welcome your help in making Jenkins X even more awesome.

Jenkins X is written largely in Go, but you don't need to be an expert to contribute! If you are new to the project, search for issues labelled "good-first-issue". Our [Contributing Guide](https://jenkins-x.io/community/code/) has advice for getting started with contributing to Jenkins X.

### Contribute to the docs

We welcome your help in improving the Jenkins X documenation. If you see areas of the documentation that need fixing or augmentation please raise a pull request. Our guide for [Contributing to the Documentation](https://jenkins-x.io/community/documentation/) has advice for getting started with contributing to the Jenkins X docs.

### Ask us questions

We're happy to help if you have any questions. Talk to us on our slack channels, which are part of the Kubernetes slack. Join  Kubernetes slack [here](http://slack.k8s.io/) and find us on our channels:

* #jenkins-x-dev for developers of Jenkins X
