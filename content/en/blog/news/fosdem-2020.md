For the first time, there will be a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) devroom at FOSDEM! The CI/CD devroom will take place on **2nd of February 2020 in Brussels, Belgium**.

## FOSDEM

[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2020/about/) (Free and Open source Software Developersâ€™ European Meeting) is a non-commercial, volunteer-organized European event centered on free and open source software development. 

It is aimed at developers and anyone interested in the free and open source software movement. FOSDEM will take place on 1st and 2nd of February in Brussels, Belgium. See the [event site for more details](https://fosdem.org/2020/).

## About the CI/CD Devroom

The CI/CD devroom focuses on Free and Open Source CI/CD tools and software at large, and is not specific to Jenkins X. We think it is very important for creators and users of CI/CD tools to share ideas, best practices, and stories from the trenches. 

Real examples are always inspiring and full of insights, even when things don't go perfectly. We'd love to hear about interesting use-cases for CI/CD tools and pipelines. Also, talks on changing tools, either from proprietary to open source or between FOSS solutions, and the reasons why, can illuminate the differences between CI/CD tools and what users really want and need.

## Call for Participation

Talks can be on anything related to open source CI/CD tools and software!

Please submit your proposals through FOSDEM's pentabarf system at https://penta.fosdem.org/submission/FOSDEM20. If you already have an account, please use the same as they show speakers' participation across the editions.  Take your time to fill up the fields, especially the descriptions, as that will be shown on FOSDEM website and booklets. Talks can be either 20 or 50 minutes, including time for questions and discussion.

Remember to select the "Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment devroom" track.

Note that the talks will be recorded and made available under a Creative Commons license on the FOSDEM website.

## Important Dates

The deadline for submission of proposals is **30th November, 2019**.

The final schedule for the CI/CD devroom at FOSDEM 2020 will be announced on 15th of December, 2019.

**If you have any issues or questions, contact ci-cd-devroom-manager@fosdem.org**

We're excited to hear all the talks and discussions in the CI/CD devroom and look forward to seeing you there!
