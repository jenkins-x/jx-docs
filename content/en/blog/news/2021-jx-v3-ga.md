I'm super excited to announce the 3.0 GA (General Availability) release of Jenkins X!

<img width="387px" src="/images/jxxx.png">

Jenkins X automates your CI/CD on kubernetes to help you [accelerate](/v3/devops/accelerate/):

* [Automated CI/CD pipelines](/v3/develop/create-project/) lets you focus on your actually application code while Jenkins X automatically creates battle tested [Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline)  CI/CD pipelines for your project which are [managed via GitOps](/blog/2021/02/25/gitops-pipelines/) so that its super easy to keep your pipelines up to date across your repositories or to upgrade or [override pipelines or steps](/v3/develop/pipelines/catalog/#overriding-a-pipeline-step-locally) for specific repositories.
* [Automatic promotion of versioned artifacts](/v3/develop/environments/promotion) via [GitOps](/v3/devops/patterns/gitops/) through your [Environments](/v3/develop/environments/) such as `Staging`, `Pre-production` and `Production` whether they are running in the same kubernetes cluster or you are using [multiple clusters for your environments](/v3/admin/guides/multi-cluster/)  
* [Preview Environments](/v3/develop/environments/preview/) lets you propose code changes via Pull Requests and have a Preview Environment automatically created, running your code in kubernetes to get fast feedback from your team before agreeing to merge changes to the main branch
* [ChatOps](/v3/develop/developing/#using-chatops) comment on Pull Requests to give feedback, approve/hold changes, trigger optional pipelines for additional testing and other [ChatOps commands](/v3/develop/reference/chatops/)

## Demo

Here's a [demo](/v3/develop/developing/#demo) of [how to develop code with Jenkins X](/v3/develop/developing/)

## Documentation

the main documentation of the changes are:

* [the new architecture](/v3/about/overview/) with modular plugins and improved [extension points](/v3/about/extending/)
* [what has changed since 3.x started](/v3/about/changes/)
* [how 3.x compares to 2.x](/v3/about/comparison/)
* [DevOps Guides](/v3/devops/) and [DevOps Patterns](/v3/devops/patterns/) provides an overview of our learnings in the DevOps space

here's a brief summary of the differences:

### Changes since the 3.x beta

The following [improvements have been made since the first beta](/v3/about/changes/):

* [Integrated observability and monitoring](/blog/2021/04/01/jx3-builtin-observability/) with [Pipeline Tracing](/blog/2021/04/08/jx3-pipeline-trace/)
* [Auto scale preview environments with Osiris](/blog/2021/04/01/jx3-osiris-preview-envs/)
* [Enable auto upgrade](/v3/admin/setup/upgrades/cluster/#automatic-upgrades) to keep your cluster up to date

### User Changes since 2.x

As a user the high level UX of Jenkins X is similar:

* [automated Continuous Delivery pipelines](/about/concepts/features/#automated-pipelines) for using [tekton](/v3/develop/pipeline-catalog/) for your repositories with [automatic promotion](/about/concepts/features/#promotion) between your [environments](/about/concepts/features/#environments)
* pull requests on your repositories create separate [Preview Environments](/about/concepts/features/#preview-environments) where your team can review your changes and give fast feedback before your changes are approved and merged into the main trunk.

#### New features

* we now default to [vanilla tekton YAML for defining pipelines](/v3/develop/pipeline-catalog/#source-changes) while [accelerating your tekton](/blog/2020/11/11/accelerate-tekton/) with [tekton catalog](/v3/develop/pipeline-catalog/#adding-tasks-from-the-tekton-catalog)
* we include an open source [dashboard](/v3/develop/ui/dashboard/) for visualising pipelines and logs which you can invoke via:

```bash
jx dash
```

* we have a full [Kubernetes and Jenkins X console](/v3/develop/ui/octant/) based on the excellent [octant](https://octant.dev/) which you can try out via:  

```bash
jx ui
```

### Platform Changes

* we now use [helm](https://helm.sh/) (3.x) and [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile) along with optionally [kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) in a GitOps style to define and configure both Jenkins X itself, your tools and applications in any namespace
* support [multi cluster](/v3/admin/guides/multi-cluster/) out of the box so you can keep `Staging` and `Production` in separate clusters to your development cluster where your pipelines run, you create and release immutable container images and other artifacts.
* to [setup or upgrade](/v3/admin/) Jenkins X we use [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to setup your cloud resources on [Azure](/v3/admin/platforms/azure/), [Amazon](/v3/admin/platforms/eks/) or [Google](/v3/admin/platforms/google/) while also supporting on-premises, minkube and OpenShift - see the [Admin Guides](/v3/admin/) for more detail
  * the actual installation of kubernetes resources takes place using the [git operator](/v3/admin/guides/operator/) so it runs reliably inside the cluster itself
* we default to using [Kubernetes External Secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/kubernetes-external-secrets) to manage all secrets for Jenkins X itself, development tools and your applications too.
  * This means we can support various secret backends such as Alibaba Cloud KMS Secret Manager, Amazon Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, Hashicorp Vault or GCP Secret Manager
  * It also means we can then check in all kubernetes resources and custom resources directly into git (apart from Kubernetes `Secrets`) so that it super easy to version, review and reason about your kubernetes resources in a GitOps way.
* built in [TLS and DNS](/v3/admin/guides/tls_dns/) support along with [Heath](/v3/admin/guides/health/) reporting and visualising via [kuberhealthy](https://github.com/Comcast/kuberhealthy)
* we now have an [LTS distribution](/v3/admin/setup/upgrades/lts/) which lets you switch to a much more slower cadence of releases of Jenkins X

We have been using Jenkins X 3.x in production now for many months (for CI/CD of all of the [3.x codebase](/v3/about/overview/source/) and [continuously upgrading our cluster in the standard way](/v3/admin/setup/upgrades/) and it's been much simpler and easier to use, operate and configure.

We have also been continuously delivering changes from Jenkins X into our production cluster for many months now and it's been working great - [GitOps](/v3/devops/patterns/gitops/) FTW!

In general Jenkins X 3.x is now much simpler and more flexible. It supports [lots more platforms than before](/v3/admin/) and should be easy to extend and configure for other platforms too.

### Getting started

If you have never tried [3.x](/v3/about/) before then please follow the [Admin Guide](/v3/admin/) to get Jenkins X installed on your cloud provider, on-premises kubernetes cluster or minikube.

If you previously tried the 3.x alpha then the [migration instructions are here](/v3/admin/guides/migrate/v3-alpha/).

For folks on older 2.x versions of Jenkins X please see [the 2.x migration instructions](/v3/admin/guides/migrate/v2/)

Once your cluster has been installed or migrated then check out the [User Guide](/v3/develop/) on how to develop software continuously with Jenkins X.

### Final thoughts

A huge thanks goes out to all the [contributors](/community/#contributors), folks in the [Jenkins X community](/community/) and the [community around all the open source projects we reuse](/v3/about/overview/projects/) who've helped get this beta together. The improvements in Jenkins X 3.x since 2.x are totally amazing, well done everyone!

Please give Jenkins X a try and [let us know what you think](https://jenkins-x.io/community/#slack) or [raise an issue](https://github.com/jenkins-x/issues
). All feedback highly appreciated - particularly how we can keep improving to help you develop faster.

If you are at all interested in Continuous Delivery with kubernetes using [tools](/v3/about/overview/projects/) like [helm](https://helm.sh/), [helmfile](https://github.com/roboll/helmfile), [knative](https://knative.dev/),  [lighthouse](https://github.com/jenkins-x/lighthouse) and last but definitely not least, [tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli)  then please join the [community](/community/) - its great fun!

For any questions and feedback please reach out on slack <https://jenkins-x.io/community/#slack>
