## Jenkins X at JenkinsWorld


[Jenkins World](https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/) has combined with DevOps world to become the premier DevOps event in your calendar this year - and there really isn't much time left if you still have to register. The event is happening at San Francisco 16-19 September, and Nice,France  22-25 October.  To get a discount on entry - you are invited to use the dscount code: JWRDAVIES

Some of the Jenkins X team, including James Strachan, James Rawlings, Rob Davies and Pete Muir will be available if you want some extra help with the Jenkins X project - we are cheap too - beer tokens gratefully received.

There will be interactive Jenkins X demonstrations at the Jenkins X community booth and the exhibition theatre. There will be Jenkins X book signings and much more.

There is a [Jenkins X workshop](https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2018.sched.com/event/FYjb/building-continuous-delivery-for-microservices-with-jenkins-x-25?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no), which is unfortunately already sold out!

James Strachan will be presenting [Jenkins X: Continuous Delivery for Kubernetes](https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2018.sched.com/event/FlPE/jenkins-x-continuous-delivery-for-kubernetes?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) on Tuesday 18 Sep

and James Rawlings and Rob Davies will be presenting [Extending Jenkins X for fun](https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2018.sched.com/event/GFmE/extending-jenkins-x-for-fun-and-profit?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) on Tuesday 18 Sep too
