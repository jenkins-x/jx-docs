Jenkins X incredibly happy to participate in [Google Summer of Code 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/)!

Jenkins X has been open source from its inception and many of the founders and core contributors to Jenkins X have been deeply involved in open source for years. We love open source for many reasons, including how it enables rapid innovation and collaboration among remote, distributed teams and communities. For these reasons and more, we are very happy to participate in Google Summer of Code.

## What is Google Summer of Code

Google Summer of Code is a global program focused on bringing more student developers into open source software development.

Working remotely, from anywhere in the world, successful student participants receive a stipend, enabling them to focus on their programming projects for three months. Volunteer mentors help students with project planning, provide guidance, answer questions, and introduce the student to the community.
