## jx step patch-config

Modifies a ConfigMap with the given json patch

### Synopsis

This step will take a json patch and attempt to modify the given ConfigMap. This is supposed to be used by Helm hooks to modify certain configuration values depending on the chart needs

```
jx step patch-config [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Update the plank property in the data section of a config map, which is an embedded yaml file as a string literal called config.yaml:
  jx step patch-config -m config --first-level-property config.yaml -p '["op": "replace", "path": "/plank", "value": {"foo": "bar"}]'
  
  # Update a root level property of a config map using strategic merge:
  jx step patch-config -m config -t strategic -p '{"metadata": {"initializers": {"result": {"status": "newstatus"}}}}'
```

### Options

```
  -m, --config-map string             The ConfigMap that will be modified
      --first-level-property string   The first level property within "Data:" where the json patch will be applied. If left empty, the patch will be applied to the whole ConfigMap
  -h, --help                          help for patch-config
  -o, --output string                 the output of the modified ConfigMap if dry-run was provided
  -p, --patch string                  The Json patch that will be applied to the Data within the ConfigMap
  -t, --type string                   The type of patch being provided; one of [json merge strategic] - If the "first-level-property" flag is provided, this has no effect
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -b, --batch-mode   Runs in batch mode without prompting for user input
      --verbose      Enables verbose output. The environment variable JX_LOG_LEVEL has precedence over this flag and allows setting the logging level to any value of: panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace
```
