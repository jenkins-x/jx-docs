```

### Examples

```
  #Link services from jx-staging namespace to the current namespace
  jx step link services --from-namespace jx-staging
  
  #Link services from jx-staging namespace to the jx-prod namespace
  jx step link services --from-namespace jx-staging --to-namespace jx-prod
  
  #Link services from jx-staging namespace to the jx-prod namespace including all but the ones starting with  the characters 'cheese'
  jx step link services --from-namespace jx-staging --to-namespace jx-prod --includes * --excludes cheese*
```

### Options

```
  -e, --excludes stringArray    What services from the source namespace to exclude from the linking process
  -f, --from-namespace string   The source namespace from which the linking would happen
  -h, --help                    help for link
  -i, --includes stringArray    What services from source namespace to include in the linking process
  -t, --to-namespace string     The destination namespace to which the linking would happen
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

  -b, --batch-mode   Runs in batch mode without prompting for user input (default true)
      --verbose      Enables verbose output. The environment variable JX_LOG_LEVEL has precedence over this flag and allows setting the logging level to any value of: panic, fatal, error, warning, info, debug, trace
