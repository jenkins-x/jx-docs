## jx gc helm

garbage collection for Helm ConfigMaps

### Synopsis

Garbage collect Helm ConfigMaps.  To facilitate rollbacks, Helm leaves a history of chart versions in place in Kubernetes and these should be pruned at intervals to avoid consuming excessive system resources.

```
jx gc helm [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  jx garbage collect helm
  jx gc helm
```

### Options

```
      --dry-run                      Does not perform the delete operation on Kubernetes
  -h, --help                         help for helm
      --no-backup                    Does not perform the backup operation to store files locally
  -o, --output-dir string            Relative directory to output backup to. Defaults to ./configmaps (default "configmaps")
      --revision-history-limit int   Minimum number of versions per release to keep (default 10)
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -b, --batch-mode   Runs in batch mode without prompting for user input (default true)
      --verbose      Enables verbose output. The environment variable JX_LOG_LEVEL has precedence over this flag and allows setting the logging level to any value of: panic, fatal, error, warning, info, debug, trace
```
