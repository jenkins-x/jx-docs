## jx edit deploy

Edits the deploy kind to use for your project or team

### Synopsis

Edits the deploy kind to use for your project or team

```
jx edit deploy [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Edit the deploy kind for your current project and prompts you to pick one of the available kinds
  jx edit deploy
  
  # to switch to use Knative Serve deployments
  jx edit deploy knative
  
  # to switch to normal kubernetes deployments
  jx edit deploy default
  
  # to switch to use canary deployments (requires flagger and its dependencies)
  jx edit deploy --canary
  
  # to disable canary deployments and don't ask any more questions
  jx edit deploy --canary=false -b
  
  # to disable canary deployments and confirm if you want to change the deployment kind and HPA
  jx edit deploy --canary=false
  
  # Edit the default deploy kind for your team and be prompted for answers
  jx edit deploy --team
  
  # Set the default for your team to use knative and canary but no HPA
  jx edit deploy --team knative --canary=true --hpa=false
```

### Options

```
      --canary        should we use canary rollouts (progressive delivery). e.g. using a Canary deployment via flagger. Requires the installation of flagger and istio/gloo in your cluster
  -h, --help          help for deploy
      --hpa           should we enable the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
  -k, --kind string   The kind to use which should be one of: knative, default
  -t, --team          Edits the team default
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -b, --batch-mode   Runs in batch mode without prompting for user input (default true)
      --verbose      Enables verbose output. The environment variable JX_LOG_LEVEL has precedence over this flag and allows setting the logging level to any value of: panic, fatal, error, warning, info, debug, trace
```
