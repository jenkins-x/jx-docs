## jx step post install

Runs any post install actions

### Synopsis

This pipeline step ensures that all the necessary jobs are imported and the webhooks set up - e.g. for the current Environments. 

It is designed to work with GitOps based development environments where the permanent Environments like Staging and Production are defined in a git repository. This step is used to ensure that all the 'Environment' resources have their associated CI+CD jobs setup in Jenkins or Prow with the necessary webhooks in place.

```

### Options

```
      --env-job-credentials string   The Jenkins credentials used by the GitOps Job for this environment
  -h, --help                         help for install
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -b, --batch-mode   Runs in batch mode without prompting for user input
      --verbose      Enables verbose output. The environment variable JX_LOG_LEVEL has precedence over this flag and allows setting the logging level to any value of: panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace
