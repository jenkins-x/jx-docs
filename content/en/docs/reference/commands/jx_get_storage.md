## jx get storage

Display the storage configuration for different classifications

### Synopsis

Display the storage configuration for different classifications.
  
Currently Jenkins X supports storing files into a branch of a git repository or in cloud blob storage like S3, GCS, Azure blobs etc. 

When using Cloud Storage we use URLs like 's3://nameOfBucket' on AWS, 'gs://anotherBucket' on GCP or on Azure 'azblob://thatBucket'
