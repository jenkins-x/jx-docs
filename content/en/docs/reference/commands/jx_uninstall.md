## jx uninstall

Uninstall the Jenkins X platform

### Synopsis

Uninstalls the Jenkins X platform from a Kubernetes cluster. This will remove all Jenkins X components, secrets, config and namespaces including any environment related namespaces

```
jx uninstall [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Uninstall the Jenkins X platform
  jx uninstall
```

### Options

```
      --context string      The kube context to uninstall JX from. This will be compared with the current context to prevent accidental uninstallation from the wrong cluster
  -h, --help                help for uninstall
      --keep-environments   Don't delete environments. Uninstall Jenkins X only.
  -n, --namespace string    The team namespace to uninstall. Defaults to the current namespace.
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -b, --batch-mode   Runs in batch mode without prompting for user input
      --verbose      Enables verbose output. The environment variable JX_LOG_LEVEL has precedence over this flag and allows setting the logging level to any value of: panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace
```
