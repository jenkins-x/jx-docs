## jx boot

Boots up Jenkins X in a Kubernetes cluster using GitOps and a Jenkins X Pipeline

### Synopsis

Boots up Jenkins X in a Kubernetes cluster using GitOps and a Jenkins X Pipeline 

For more documentation see: https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/

```
jx boot [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # create a kubernetes cluster via Terraform or via jx
  jx create cluster gke --skip-installation
  
  # now lets boot up Jenkins X installing/upgrading whatever is needed
  jx boot
  
  # if we have already booted and just want to apply some environment changes without
  # re-applying ingress and so forth we can start at the environment step:
  jx boot --start-step install-env
```

### Options

```
  -a, --attempt-restore        attempt to boot from an existing dev environment repository
  -d, --dir string             the directory to look for the Jenkins X Pipeline, requirements and charts (default ".")
  -e, --end-step string        the step in the pipeline to end at
      --git-ref string         override the Git ref for the JX Boot source to start from, ignoring the versions stream. Normally specified with git-url as well
  -u, --git-url string         override the Git clone URL for the JX Boot source to start from, ignoring the versions stream. Normally specified with git-ref as well
  -v, --helm-log string        sets the helm logging level from 0 to 9. Passed into the helm CLI via the '-v' argument. Useful to diagnose helm related issues
  -h, --help                   help for boot
      --no-update-git          disables any attempt to update the local git clone if its old
  -r, --requirements string    requirements file which will overwrite the default requirements file
  -s, --start-step string      the step in the pipeline to start from
      --versions-ref string    the bootstrap ref for the versions repo. Once the boot config is cloned, the repo will be then read from the jx-requirements.yml (default "master")
      --versions-repo string   the bootstrap URL for the versions repo. Once the boot config is cloned, the repo will be then read from the jx-requirements.yml (default "https://github.com/jenkins-x/jenkins-x-versions.git")
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -b, --batch-mode   Runs in batch mode without prompting for user input (default true)
      --verbose      Enables verbose output. The environment variable JX_LOG_LEVEL has precedence over this flag and allows setting the logging level to any value of: panic, fatal, error, warning, info, debug, trace
```
