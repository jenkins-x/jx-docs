## jx step split

Mirrors the code from a monorepo into separate microservice style Git repositories so its easier to do finer grained releases

### Synopsis

Mirrors the code from a monorepo into separate microservice style Git repositories so its easier to do finer grained releases. 

If you have lots of apps in folders in a monorepo then this command can run on that repo to mirror changes into a number of microservice based repositories which can each then get auto-imported into Jenkins X

```
jx step split monorepo [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Split the current folder up into separate Git repositories
  jx step split monorepo -o mygithuborg
```

### Options

```
  -g, --glob string                The glob pattern to find folders to mirror to separate repositories (default "*")
  -h, --help                       help for split
      --kubernetes-folder string   The folder containing all the Kubernetes YAML for each app (default "kubernetes")
      --no-git                     If enabled then don't try to clone/create the separate repositories in github
  -o, --organisation string        The GitHub organisation to split the repositories into
  -d, --output-dir string          The output directory where new projects are created (default "generated")
  -n, --reponame string            The GitHub monorepo to be split
  -s, --source-dir string          The source directory to look inside for the folders to move into separate Git repositories
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -b, --batch-mode   Runs in batch mode without prompting for user input
      --verbose      Enables verbose output. The environment variable JX_LOG_LEVEL has precedence over this flag and allows setting the logging level to any value of: panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace
