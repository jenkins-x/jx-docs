## jx delete application

Note that this command does not remove the underlying Git Repositories. 

For that see the https://jenkins-x.io/commands/jx_delete_repo/command.

```
jx delete application [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # prompt for the available applications to delete
  jx delete application
  
  # delete a specific app
  jx delete application cheese
```

      --no-env                          Do not remove the application from any of the Environments
      --no-merge                        Disables automatic merge of promote Pull Requests

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -b, --batch-mode   Runs in batch mode without prompting for user input (default true)
      --verbose      Enables verbose output. The environment variable JX_LOG_LEVEL has precedence over this flag and allows setting the logging level to any value of: panic, fatal, error, warning, info, debug, trace
