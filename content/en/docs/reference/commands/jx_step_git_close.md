## jx step git close

Closes issue trackers, wikis and projects

### Synopsis

This pipeline step will close git provider issue trackers, wikis and projects that are not in use (no issues, no wiki pages, no projects). It will log any it can't close, indicating why.

```
jx step git close [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Close unused issue trackers, wikis and projects for organizations
  jx step git close --org https://github.com/jenkins-x --org https://github.com/jenkins-x
  
  # Close unused issue trackers, wikis and projects for an organization
  jx step git close --org https://github.com/jenkins-x --include jenkins-x/jx
```

### Options

```
      --dir string            The directory in which the git repo is checked out, by default the working directory
      --dry-run               execute as a dry run - print what would be done but exit before making any changes
      --exclude stringArray   A repo to ignore when closing issue trackers, wikis and projects e.g. jenkins-x/jx
  -h, --help                  help for close
      --include stringArray   If any includes are specified then only those repos will have issue trackers, wikis and projects closed
      --org stringArray       An org to close issue trackers, wikis and projects for
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
  -b, --batch-mode   Runs in batch mode without prompting for user input (default true)
      --verbose      Enables verbose output. The environment variable JX_LOG_LEVEL has precedence over this flag and allows setting the logging level to any value of: panic, fatal, error, warn, info, debug, trace
```
