If you want an open source web UI for working with Jenkins X we highly recommend [Octant](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant) along with the [octant-jx](https://github.com/jenkins-x/octant-jx) plugin.

See the [installation guide](https://github.com/jenkins-x/octant-jx#install) to get started.

## Why Octant?

We love [Octant](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/octant) because:

* open source and very easy to extend with plugins in Go or TypeScript/JavaScript
* lets you visualise and work with all kubernetes and custom resources across multiple clusters
* thanks to [octant-jx](https://github.com/jenkins-x/octant-jx)  has awesome integration with Jenkins X components like apps, environments, pipelines, repositories etc.

## Features

Longer term we're planning on making most of the developer and operations feaures of Jenkins X available through the UI via [octant-jx](https://github.com/jenkins-x/octant-jx) but already you can:

* view applications, environments, pipelines, repositories
* for a pipeline quickly navigate to:
  * its Pod, Log, Pull Request or Preview Environment
  * for each step you can view the step detail or log of the step
* see the various jobs and pipelines used to operate Jenkins X itself
* over time will add management UI capabilities for installing, upgrading and administering Jenkins
