We [recently announced](/news/jenkins-x-next-gen-pipeline-engine) that we are introducing **Jenkins X Pipelines**, a new serverless pipeline execution engine based on the [Tekton Pipelines](https://tekton.dev/) open source project.

Tekton has been designed to be a modern cloud native solution for running pipelines.

The work here is still experimental but we'd love feedback and help from the community to drive it forward.

## Trying Jenkins X Pipelines

Right now to enable a Tekton based install you can create a new cluster using `jx` along with these flags:

```sh
jx create cluster gke --tekton
```

Or if you want to go all in on the next generation of Jenkins X with built-in GitOps for your development environment, using Tekton and using Vault for storage of Secrets then use the following (only works on GCP and AWS right now):

```sh
jx create cluster gke --ng
```

The general developer experience, CLI and IDE plugins should work as before - but using [Tekton Pipelines](https://tekton.dev/) Custom Resources under the covers instead of creating a Jenkins Server per team!

## Using a quickstart

Once your cluster is started you can create a new quickstart, we've been using the NodeJS one reliably.

```sh
jx create quickstart
```

A `prowjob` is created, a new prow pipeline controller watches for these jobs and when it receives an event it will check if it has a `pipelinerun` spec present, if not it will post the `prowjob` to a new `pipelinerunner` service from Jenkins X which in turn clones the repo and revision then translates its `jenkins-x.yml` into vanilla Tekton Pipeline resources.  Once they are created the `tekton-pipeline-controller` executes the builds.

## Differences to Jenkins Pipelines

Jenkins X Pipelines use a new `jenkins-x.yml` file which is YAML instead of the Groovy `Jenkinsfile` used by Jenkins.

However it's still reusing the same reusable and composable build packs under the covers. (The Jenkins X [build packs](/docs/managing-jx/common-tasks/build-packs/) are actually written in Jenkins X Pipelines YAML).

One thing you will notice is that with Jenkins X Pipelines we don't need to copy/paste a large `Jenkinsfile` into each application's git repository; usually the generated `jenkins-x.yml` file is small, like this:

```yaml
buildPack: maven
```

That's it! What that basically means is at runtime the Jenkins X Pipeline will use the [build packs](/docs/managing-jx/common-tasks/build-packs/) to generate the actual Tekton Pipeline.

## Customizing the Pipelines

Having automated [build packs](/docs/managing-jx/common-tasks/build-packs/) to do all of your CI+CD is pretty awesome - as most of the time your microservices will all be compiled, tested, packaged, released and promoted in the same way. CI+CD is often undifferentiated heavy lifting we should just automate!

However there are times you want to customize a [particular pipeline](/docs/managing-jx/common-tasks/build-packs/#pipelines) (release, pull request, feature etc) and a particular [life cycle](/docs/managing-jx/common-tasks/build-packs/#lifecycles) to change the actual steps invoked.

You can read more about the [extension model](/docs/managing-jx/common-tasks/build-packs/#pipeline-extension-model) to find out all you can do. Basically you can add steps before/after any life cycle or completely replace a set of life cycles or even opt out of the build pack completely and inline your pipelines inside your `jenkins-x.yml`

For a quick way to add a new step into a pipeline life cycle you can use the [jx create step](/commands/jx_create_step/) command:

You can also add or override an environment variable in your pipeline via the [jx create variable](/commands/jx_create_variable/) command

## Editing in VS Code

If you are using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend you install the [YAML Language Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) from Red Hat.

This extension lets you edit YAML files with optional JSON Schema validation.

Jenkins X's JSON Schema is already registered with [schemastore.org](http://schemastore.org/json/) so editing your `jenkins-x.yml` file in VS Code will include smart completion and validation!

We'd love to improve this UX if you fancy [helping out](/docs/contributing/).

## Editing in IDEA

This should already be interested out of the box due to the Jenkins X JSON Schema being registered with [schemastore.org](http://schemastore.org/json/) so editing your `jenkins-x.yml` file in IDEA will include smart completion and validation!

We'd love to improve this UX if you fancy [helping out](/docs/contributing/).

## Default environment variables

The following environment variables are available for use in a step in Jenkins X Pipelines:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| DOCKER_REGISTRY | the docker registry host (e.g. `docker.io` or `gcr.io`) |
| BUILD_NUMBER | the build number (1, 2, 3) starts at `1` for each repo and branch |
| PIPELINE_KIND | the kind of pipeline such as `release` or `pullrequest` |
| PIPELINE_CONTEXT | the pipeline context if there are multiple pipelines per PR (for different tests/governance/lint etc) |
| REPO_OWNER | the git repository owner |
| REPO_NAME | the git repository name |
| JOB_NAME | the job name which typically looks like `$REPO_OWNER/$REPO_NAME/$BRANCH_NAME` |
| APP_NAME | the name of the app which typically is the `$REPO_NAME`
| BRANCH_NAME | the name of the branch such as `master` or `PR-123` |
| JX_BATCH_MODE | indicates to jx to use batch mode if `true` |
| VERSION | contains the version number being released or the PR's preview version |
| BUILD_ID | same as `$BUILD_NUMBER`
| JOB_TYPE | the prow job type such as `presubmit` for PR or `postsubmit` for release |
| PULL_BASE_REF | the branch/ref of git |
| PULL_BASE_SHA | the git SHA being built |
| PULL_NUMBER | for PRs this will be the number without the `PR-` prefix
| PULL_REFS | for batch merging all the git refs |
