Jenkins X is designed to work on any Kubernetes cluster; whether on premise, hybrid or public cloud.

However, if you try doing any significant work with Kubernetes particularly with things like storage, networking, ingress, TLS, certificates, DNS,secrets - you will find that things can be different on different cloud providers.

This section of the documentation will try guide you through the best way to use Jenkins X on different cloud providers.

Refer to the [Jenkins X Capabilities Matrix](/about/capabilities) for cloud provider support maturity.
