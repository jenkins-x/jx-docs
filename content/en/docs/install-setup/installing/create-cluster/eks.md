{{% alert  %}}
The EKS Terraform module for Jenkins X is published in the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/jenkins-x/eks-jx/aws).
The source is in the [terraform-aws-eks-jx](https://github.com/jenkins-x/terraform-aws-eks-jx) repository on GitHub.
{{% /alert %}}

## Prerequisites

The EKS Terraform module for Jenkins X allows you to create an [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) cluster for installation of Jenkins X.
You need the following binaries locally installed and configured on your _PATH_:

- `terraform` (~> 0.12.0)
- `kubectl` (>=1.10)
- `aws-iam-authenticator`

## Cluster provisioning

A default Jenkins X ready cluster can be provisioned by creating a _main.tf_ file in an empty directory with the following content:

```
module "eks-jx" {
  source  = "jenkins-x/eks-jx/aws"
}

output "vault_user_id" {
  value       = module.eks-jx.vault_user_id
  description = "The Vault IAM user id"
}

output "vault_user_secret" {
  value       = module.eks-jx.vault_user_secret
  description = "The Vault IAM user secret"
}
```

Due to the Vault issue [7450](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/7450), the Terraform module needs to create a new IAM user for installing Vault.
It also creates an IAM access key whose id and secret are defined in the output above.
You need the id and secret for running [`jx boot`](#running-jx-boot).

If you do not want Terraform to create a new IAM user or you do not have permissions to create one, you need to provide the name of an existing IAM user.

```
module "eks-jx" {
  source  = "jenkins-x/eks-jx/aws"

  vault_user="<your_vault_iam_username>"
}
```

The IAM user does not need any permissions attached to it.
For more information, refer to [Configuring Vault for EKS](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/clouds/amazon/#configuring-vault-for-eks) in the Jenkins X documentation.

Once you have your initial configuration, you can apply it by running:

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply
```

This creates an EKS cluster with all possible configuration options defaulted.

You then need to export the environment variables _VAULT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_ and _VAULT_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_.

```sh
export VAULT_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(terraform output vault_user_id)
export VAULT_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(terraform output vault_user_secret)
```

If you specified _vault_user_ you need to provide the access key id and secret for the specified user.

This example is for getting up and running quickly.
It is not intended for a production cluster.
Refer to [Production cluster considerations](#production-cluster-considerations) for things to consider when creating a production cluster.

## Long Term Storage

You can choose to create S3 buckets for long term storage and enable them in the generated _jx-requirements.yml_ file with `enable_logs_storage`, `enable_reports_storage` and `enable_repository_storage`.

For more information refer to the [Storage](/docs/resources/guides/managing-jx/common-tasks/storage/) section.

## Vault

Vault is used by Jenkins X for managing secrets.
Part of this module's responsibilities is the creation of all resources required to run the [Vault Operator](https://github.com/banzaicloud/bank-vaults).
These resources are An S3 Bucket, a DynamoDB Table and a KMS Key.

For more information refer around Vault refer to the [Vault](/docs/reference/components/vault/) section.

## ExternalDNS

You can enable [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) with the `enable_external_dns` variable. This modifies the generated _jx-requirements.yml_ file to enable External DNS when running `jx boot`.

If `enable_external_dns` is _true_, additional configuration is required. If you want to use a domain with an already existing Route 53 Hosted Zone, you can provide it through the `apex_domain` variable:

This domain will be configured in the resulting _jx-requirements.yml_ file in the following section:

```yaml
    ingress:
      domain: ${domain}
      ignoreLoadBalancer: true
      externalDNS: ${enable_external_dns}
```

If you want to use a subdomain and have this module create and configure a new Hosted Zone with DNS delegation, you can provide the following variables:

`subdomain`: This subdomain is added to the apex domain and configured in the resulting _jx-requirements.yml_ file.

`create_and_configure_subdomain`: This flag instructs the script to create a new `Route53 Hosted Zone` for your subdomain and configure DNS delegation with the apex domain.

By providing these variables, the script creates a new `Route 53` HostedZone that looks like `<subdomain>.<apex_domain>`, then it delegates the resolving of DNS to the apex domain.
This is done by creating a `NS` RecordSet in the apex domain's Hosted Zone with the subdomain's HostedZone nameservers.

This ensures that the newly created HostedZone for the subdomain is instantly resolvable instead of having to wait for DNS propagation.

## cert-manager

You can enable [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) to use TLS for your cluster through LetsEncrypt with the `enable_tls` variable.

[LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) has two environments, `staging` and `production`.

If you use staging, you will receive self-signed certificates, but you are not rate-limited, if you use the `production` environment, you receive certificates signed by LetsEncrypt, but you can be rate limited.

You can choose to use the `production` environment with the `production_letsencrypt` variable:

You need to provide a valid email to register your domain in LetsEncrypt with `tls_email`.

## Production cluster considerations

The configuration, as seen in [Cluster provisioning](#cluster-provisioning), is not suited for creating and maintaining a production Jenkins X cluster.
The following is a list of considerations for a production use case.

- Specify the version attribute of the module, for example:

    ```
    module "jx" {
      source  = "jenkins-x/eks-jx/aws"
      version = "1.0.0"
      # insert your configuration
    }
    ```

  Specifying the version ensures that you are using a fixed version and that version upgrades cannot occur unintended.

- Keep the Terraform configuration under version control by creating a dedicated repository for your cluster configuration or by adding it to an already existing infrastructure repository.

- Setup a Terraform backend to securely store and share the state of your cluster. For more information refer to [Configuring a Terraform backend](#configuring-a-terraform-backend).

## Configuring a Terraform backend

A "[backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html)" in Terraform determines how state is loaded and how an operation such as _apply_ is executed.
By default, Terraform uses the _local_ backend, which keeps the state of the created resources on the local file system.
This is problematic since sensitive information will be stored on disk and it is not possible to share state across a team.
When working with AWS a good choice for your Terraform backend is the [_s3_ backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/s3.html)  which stores the Terraform state in an AWS S3 bucket.
The [examples](https://github.com/jenkins-x/terraform-aws-eks-jx/examples) directory of the [terraform-aws-eks-jx](https://github.com/jenkins-x/terraform-aws-eks-jx) repository contains configuration examples for using the _s3_ backed.

To use the _s3_ backend, you will need to create the bucket upfront.
You need the S3 bucket as well as a Dynamo table for state locks.
You can use [terraform-aws-tfstate-backend](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-tfstate-backend) to create these resources.

## Running `jx boot`

Applying the _terraform-aws-eks-jx_ Terraform module will not only create the [required cloud resources](/docs/getting-started/setup/create-cluster/required-cloud-resources), but also create a _jx-requirements.yml_ file.
From within an empty directory run:

```bash
 jx boot -r <path-to-generated-jx-requirements.yml>
```

More information about the boot process can be found in the [Run Boot](/docs/getting-started/setup/boot) section.
