OK so you have [got the jx CLI](/getting-started/install/) and you either

* [created a Kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X](/getting-started/create-cluster/)
* [installed Jenkins X on an existing kubernetes cluster](/getting-started/install-on-cluster/)

So whats next?

Well the [Using Jenkins X](/docs/resources/guides/using-jx/) section contains the next steps you may want to try out, such as

* [create a new Spring Boot application and import it into Jenkins X](/docs/resources/guides/using-jx/common-tasks/create-spring/)
* [create a new quickstart and import it into Jenkins X](/docs/getting-started/first-project/create-quickstart/)
* [import existing source code into Jenkins X](/docs/resources/guides/using-jx/creating/import/)
* [browsing](/docs/resources/guides/using-jx/developing/browsing/) for browsing pipelines, builds, apps and activity

You may also want to check out the [various demonstrations of what you can do with Jenkins X](/demos/)

If you're looking for a UI, there is one available for the [CloudBees Jenkins X Distribution](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-jenkins-x-distribution/overview). It should normally work on OSS Jenkins X as well, though CloudBees won't support it unless you're also using their distribution. You can read more about it here: [Using the CloudBees Jenkins X Distribution user interface
](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-jenkins-x-distribution/latest/user-interface/)
