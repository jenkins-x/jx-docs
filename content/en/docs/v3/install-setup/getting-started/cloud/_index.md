If you are using Google Cloud and you just want to give Jenkins X a try, we recommend using [gcloud](/docs/v3/install-setup/getting-started/cloud/gcloud/) to setup your Kubernetes cluster.

If you are setting up a production installation of Jenkins X have a look at our [Terraform](/docs/v3/install-setup/getting-started/cloud/terraform/) setup.
