### GKE + Terraform + Vault
This is our current recommended quickstart for GKE:

*  <a href="https://github.com/jx3-gitops-repositories/jx3-gke-terraform-vault/generate" target="github" class="btn bg-primary text-light">Create Git Repository</a> 

* `git clone` the new repository and `cd`  into the git clone

*  <a href="https://github.com/jx3-gitops-repositories/jx3-gke-terraform-vault/blob/master/bin/README.md" 
    target="github" class="btn bg-primary text-light" 
    title="use your new git repository to create your cloud infrastructure and install Jenkins X">
    Create your infrastructure
  </a> 

*  <a href="/docs/v3/create-project/" class="btn bg-primary text-light">Create or import projects</a> 


### GKE + gcloud + Vault 
This quickstart is similar to the above but does not use terraform so its ideal if you just want to create a quick cluster to kick the tyres without needing to learn terraform.

*  <a href="https://github.com/jx3-gitops-repositories/jx3-gke-gcloud-vault/generate" target="github" class="btn bg-primary text-light">Create Git Repository</a> 

* `git clone` the new repository and `cd`  into the git clone

*  <a href="https://github.com/jx3-gitops-repositories/jx3-gke-gcloud-vault/blob/master/bin/README.md" 
    target="github" class="btn bg-primary text-light" 
    title="use your new git repository to create your cloud infrastructure and install Jenkins X">
    Create your infrastructure
  </a> 

*  <a href="/docs/v3/create-project/" class="btn bg-primary text-light">Create or import projects</a>
