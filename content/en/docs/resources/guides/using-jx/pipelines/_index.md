  How to create and modify your own Jenkins X Pipeline
---

This section goes into more detail on what you can do with a Jenkins X Pipeline and how to deal with specific use cases.

There are two main ways of creating a new pipeline:

* Create a new project using a [quick start](/docs/resources/guides/using-jx/creating/)
* Create a new `jenkins-x.yml` file and build a pipeline from scratch

Naturally, the first option is the simplest, even for having a starting point, but you can always start from scratch and just [import your existing project](/docs/resources/guides/using-jx/creating/import/)

The pages youâ€™ll find in this section will apply to both ways of creating a pipeline
