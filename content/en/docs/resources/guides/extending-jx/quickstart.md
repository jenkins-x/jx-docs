## Custom Quickstarts

Jenkins X ships with a series of quickstarts that provide you with pre-made applications that you can start a project with.

You can create your own quickstarts that give your team members a starting point. Read more about [creating quickstarts](/docs/create-project/creating/).

You can customize the list of quickstarts available to your team making it easier for them to select the right place to start. Read more about [customizing the quickstarts available](/docs/create-project/creating/#customising-your-teams-quickstarts).
