## Official Artwork

Jenkins X logos can be downloaded in a number of sizes, or as vector graphics, from [our artwork repo](https://github.com/cdfoundation/artwork/tree/master/jenkinsx). The repo also contains our brand guidelines and color palette.

You can read more about our new logo for Jenkins X [here](https://jenkins-x.io/blog/2019/07/31/new-logo-jenkins-x/).
