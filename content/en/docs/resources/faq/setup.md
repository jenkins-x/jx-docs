For more detail check out how to use [jx boot](/docs/install-setup/boot/).

## How do I upgrade boot?

If you are using [jx boot](/docs/install-setup/boot/) you can upgrade via `jx upgrade boot`.
Refer to [Upgrading Jenkins X](/docs/install-setup/upgrade-jx/#upgrading-jenkins-x) for more information.

If anything ever goes wrong (e.g. your cluster, namespace or tekton gets deleted), you can always re-run [jx boot](/docs/install-setup/boot/) on your laptop to restore your cluster.

## How do I add more resources?

Add more resources (e.g. `Ingress, ConfigMap, Secret`) to your development environment by adding YAML files to the boot `env/templates` directory.

## How do I add new Environments?

Add a new `SourceRepository` and `Environment` resource to the `env/templates` folder for each new environment you want tto create. Weâ€™ve only added `dev, staging, production` currently.

From your running cluster you can always grab the staging `SourceRepository` and `Environment` resource via the following (where XXX is the name of the staging repository returned via `kubectl get sr`):

```sh
kubectl get env staging -oyaml > env/templates/myenv.yaml
kubectl get sr XXX -oyaml > env/templates/myenv-sr.yaml
```

then modify the YAML to suit, changing the names of the resources to avoid clashing with your staging repository.

## How to to manage SourceRepository resources?

See how to update your [boot configuration with the latest SourceRepository resources](/docs/install-setup/boot/how-it-works/#source-repositories)

## How do I map SourceRepository to a custom Scheduler

You need to map your `SourceRepository` to a `Scheduler` via either specifying `--scheduler` when you `jx create quickstart / jx import` your repository or modifying the `SourceRepository` CRD's `spec.scheduler.name` in your development git repository or specifying a different default scheduler on the `dev environment.spec.teamSettings.defaultScheduler.name` then the next time the prow configuration is generated (on `jx create quickstart / jx import / jx boot` it'll update the prow config to use your scheduler

## How do I add more charts to Jenkins X?

It depends on which namespace you want the charts to be installed.

If its in the development environment (the `jx` namespace by default) then `env/requirements.yaml` is where to add the chart and for a chart `foo` you can add `env/foo/values.yaml` to configure it. (or `env/foo/values.tmpl.yaml` if you want to use some [templating](/docs/install-setup/boot/how-it-works/#improvements-to-valuesyaml) of the `values.yaml`)

Though if you want our chart to be in another namespace then we use the convention of adding a folder in the `system` directory in the boot configuration (e.g. like we do for ingress, cert manager, velero, service mesh etc). So make a new folder in `system` and add the `jx step helm apply` step in the pipeline in `jenkins-x.yml` like we do for `cert-manager`, `nginx`, `velero` etc.

## How do I disable the ingress controller?

If you already have your own ingress controller and do not want `jx boot` to install another one you can just delete the `install-nginx-controller` step in your dev environment git repository. e.g. [remove this step](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jenkins-x-boot-config/blob/master/jenkins-x.yml#L85-L99) from the `jenkins-x.yml` in your dev environment git repository

## What do I do if `jx boot` hangs on `step-install-jenkins-x`?

You may have a problem with Terminating a PVC that is protected.

Describe your pvc.  In the case I saw, it was the jenkins pvc.
```sh
kubectl -n jx describe pvc jenkins
```
If it's stuck in Terminating and you see that the Finalizer has protection:
```sh
Finalizers:    [kubernetes.io/pvc-protection]
```
Then, you can remove the protection by issuing the following command and your install should continue.
```sh
kubectl -n jx patch pvc jenkins -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers": []}}' --type=merge
```

## How do I debug issues with terraform and JenkinsX?
Set the `TF_LOG` environment variable to `TRACE`, and then run your terraform commands such as `terraform apply` or `terraform plan`.
```bash
TF_LOG=TRACE terraform apply
```
Use the global `--verbose` flag to add more verbosity to the JenkinsX logs:
```bash
jx boot --verbose
```

## How to get a clean terraform destroy
The following steps need to be performed before a terraform destroy can be executed successfully for the EKS cluster.
* Empty the s3 buckets created by jenkinsX (This is required if `force_destroy` was set to false, when provisioning 
the EKS cluster)
* Delete the Network load balancer (The load balancer is created outside terraform, so you need to delete it manually 
in the EC2 console before executing a terraform destroy.
You can also import it to terraform, and then execute destroy)

If you do not delete the load balancer, you will have issues with detaching the internet gateway (IGW) and deleting it.
This can lead to a race condition where terraform tries to destroy the auto scaling group and the IGW, and eventually
times out.

## Does Jenkins X install a load balancer?

Jenkins X installs `nginx` which has a `LoadBalancer` kubernetes `Service`. But the underlying kubernetes platform needs to implement the load balancing network and infrastructure. This comes OOTB on all public clouds. 
 
On premise you need to install something like [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf/)
