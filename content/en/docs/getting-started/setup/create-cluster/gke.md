<h3>TIP:</h3> The GKE Terraform Module for Jenkins X is published in the <a class="alert-link" href="https://registry.terraform.io/modules/jenkins-x/jx/google">[Terraform Registry]</a>.  The source is in the  <a class="alert-link" href="https://github.com/jenkins-x/terraform-google-jx">[terraform-google-jx]</a> repository on GitHub.  We welcome contributions!

## Prerequisites

To create your GKE cluster, you need first a Google Cloud project.
Instructions on how to setup a project can be found in the Google Cloud [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/deployment-manager/docs/step-by-step-guide/installation-and-setup).
You need your Google Cloud project id as input for using the Terraform Module.

You also need to install the Cloud SDK, in particular `gcloud`.
You find instructions on how to install and authenticate in the documentation mentioned above.

Once you have `gcloud` installed, you need to create [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/application-default/login) by running:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Finally, ensure you have the following binaries installed:

- `gcloud`
- `kubectl` ~> 1.14.0
    - `kubectl` comes bundled with the Cloud SDK
- `terraform` ~> 0.12.0
    - Terraform installation instruction can be found [here](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install)

## Cluster creation

A default Jenkins X ready cluster can be provisioned by creating a file _main.tf_ with the following content in an empty directory:

```tf
module "jx" {
  source  = "jenkins-x/jx/google"

  gcp_project = "<my-gcp-project-id>"
}
```

You can then apply this Terraform configuration via the following terminal commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

This creates a cluster within the specified Google Cloud project with all possible configuration options defaulted.

No custom domain is used.
Instead DNS resolution occurs via [nip.io](https://nip.io/).
For more information on how to configure and use a custom domain, refer to [Using a custom domain](/docs/getting-started/setup/create-cluster/gke#using-a-custom-domain).

If you just want to evaluate Jenkins X, you can set `force_destroy` to `true`.
This allows you to remove all generated resources when running `terraform destroy`, including any generated buckets with their content.

On completion of `terraform apply` there will be a _jx-requirements.yml_ in the working directory.
This file can be used as input for running [`jx boot`](/docs/getting-started/setup/boot).

The following sections define the various configuration variables as well as the Module's output variables.

|------|-------------|
| backup\_bucket\_url | The URL to the bucket for backup storage |
| cluster\_name | The name of the created Kubernetes cluster |
| gcp\_project | The GCP project in which the resources got created |
| log\_storage\_url | The URL to the bucket for log storage |

## Using a custom domain

If you want to use a custom domain with your Jenkins X installation, you need to provide values for the variables _parent_domain_ and _tls_email_.
_parent_domain_ is the fully qualified domain name you want to use and _tls_email_ is the email you want to use for issuing Let's Encrypt TLS certificates.

Before you run the Terraform configuration, you also need to create a [Cloud DNS managed zone](https://cloud.google.com/dns/zones), with the DNS name in the managed zone matching your custom domain name, for example in the case of _example.jenkins-x.rocks_ as domain:

![Creating a Managed Zone](/images/getting-started/create_managed_zone.png)

When creating the managed zone, a set of DNS servers get created which you need to specify in the DNS settings of your DNS registrar.

![DNS settings of a Managed Zone](/images/getting-started/managed_zone_details.png)

It is essential that before you run `jx boot`, your DNS servers settings are propagated, and your domain resolves.
You can use [DNS checker](https://dnschecker.org/) to check whether your domain settings have propagated.

When a custom domain is provided, Jenkins X uses [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) together with [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) to create A record entries in your managed zone for the various exposed applications.

If _parent_domain_ is not set, your cluster will use [nip.io](https://nip.io/) in order to create publicly resolvable URLs of the form ht<span>tp://\<app-name\>-\<environment-name\>.\<cluster-ip\>.nip.io.

## Running `jx boot`

Applying this Terraform module will not only create the [required cloud resources](/docs/getting-started/setup/create-cluster/required-cloud-resources), but also create a _jx-requirements.yml_ file.
From within an empty directory run:

```bash
 jx boot -r <path-to-generated-jx-requirements.yml>
```

More information about the boot process can be found in the [Run Boot](/docs/getting-started/setup/boot) section.
