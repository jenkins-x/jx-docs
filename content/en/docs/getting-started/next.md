OK so you have [got the jx CLI](/getting-started/install/) and you either

* [created a Kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X](/getting-started/create-cluster/)
* [installed Jenkins X on an existing kubernetes cluster](/getting-started/install-on-cluster/)

So whats next?

Well the [Using Jenkins X](/docs/using-jx/) section contains the next steps you may want to try out, such as

* [create a new Spring Boot application and import it into Jenkins X](/docs/using-jx/common-tasks/create-spring/) 
* [create a new quickstart and import it into Jenkins X](/docs/getting-started/first-project/create-quickstart/)
* [import existing source code into Jenkins X](/docs/using-jx/creating/import/)
* [browsing](/docs/using-jx/common-tasks/browsing/) for browsing pipelines, builds, apps and activity

You may also want to check out the [various demonstrations of what you can do with Jenkins X](/demos/)
