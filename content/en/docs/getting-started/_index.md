The simplest way to get started is via the [Google Cloud Tutorials](/docs/managing-jx/tutorials/google-hosted/).

Otherwise first you will need to [get the jx command line tool](/docs/getting-started/setup/install/) locally on your machine.

You can use the [jx command line](/commands/jx/#jx) to [create a new Kubernetes cluster](/docs/getting-started/setup/create-cluster) with Jenkins X installed automatically.

If you already have a Kubernetes cluster, then [install Jenkins X on your Kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X Boot](/docs/getting-started/setup/boot/).

When you have a Kubernetes cluster with Jenkins X installed, check out [your next steps](/docs/getting-started/next/).
