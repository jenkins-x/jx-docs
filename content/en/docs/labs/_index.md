We want to enable the Jenkins X open source community to move fast, innovate and iterate while at the same time keeping stability.

So we innovate within the Labs so that we can go quickly and innovate rapidly then when things are stable we can roll them into the stable Jenkins X release.

**We have reached the point where we have enough feedback, and these current experiments will be used (how much or at all to be determined) in Jenkins X. We DO NOT recommend using these experiments at all now, because the community will not be able to support you.**

For more details see the [Labs Enhancements proposal](https://github.com/rawlingsj/enhancements/blob/master/proposals/labs/README.md)
