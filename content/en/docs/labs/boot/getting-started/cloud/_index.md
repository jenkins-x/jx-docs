**NOTE: This current experiment is now closed. The work done and feedback we have received will be used to enhance Jenkins X in future versions**

If you are using Google Cloud and you just want to give Jenkins X a try, we recommend using [gcloud](/docs/labs/boot/getting-started/cloud/gcloud/) to setup your Kubernetes cluster.

If you are setting up a production installation of Jenkins X have a look at our [Terraform](/docs/labs/boot/getting-started/cloud/terraform/) setup.
