Creating a quickstart is our preferred way to create your first project inside Jenkins X. A quickstart is just a sample microservice in a particular programming language and build technology which we test with our build packs to ensure it works great with CI+CD in Jenkins X.

To see how to create a project see [Create a Quickstart](/docs/getting-started/first-project/create-quickstart/)
