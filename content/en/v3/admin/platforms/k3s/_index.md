This guide will walk you though how to setup Jenkins X on your laptop using [k3s](https://k3s.io/)

If you are on Mac OS, you can follow this [guide](https://docs.kalm.dev/install/install-local-k3s/) to set up k3s.
You do not need to install kalm for the rest of the tutorial.

If you are on Windows, you can use [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)(WSL). It lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment. This includes CLI tools,utilities, applications on Windows without the use of Virtual Machine or dual-boot setup.
### Prerequisites

#### K3s

Make sure you have created a cluster using k3s.

If you dont have an existing k3s cluster, you can install one by running:

```bash
# We don't support Kubernetes 1.22+ yet
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_CHANNEL=v1.21 sh -s - --write-kubeconfig-mode 644
sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/k3s-config
# Set it also in the bashrc or zshrc file, or you can flatten both of these configs into a single file
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config:~/.kube/k3s-config

```

**For WSL2 users:**
- Download k3s binary from https://github.com/rancher/k3s/releases/latest
- `chmod +x k3s`
- Start a new Terminal and Run k3s `sudo ./k3s server` (Don't close this terminal).


To verify that k3s has been installed successfully, and configured run:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

 - You will need to open multiple terminals later, so setting these env variables in the bashrc or zshrc might help you

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
#go to the end of the file and paste the export command
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config:~/.kube/k3s-config
```

**Optional**

- If the above method didn't work, copy the configurations to the ~/.kube/config instead (if you don't have any other clusters, that should be fine)
```bash
sudo rm ~/.kube/k3s-config  #to make k3s uses ~/.kube/config
sudo cp /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
```
- If still got `permission denied`
```bash
sudo chmod 777 ~/.kube/config #warning: this maybe vulnerable to multiple users 
```

This value of the node will be used later during installation and configuring of Jenkins X.

Check [k3s install guide](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/) for more installation options but keep in mind we don't support Kubernetes 1.22+ yet

#### Docker

You need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [manage it as a non root user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

#### Vault

Install vault cli.
Refer to the [vault docs](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install) on how to install vault for your platform.

Make sure you have vault running in a docker container with kubernetes auth enabled.
```bash
docker run --name jx-k3s-vault -d --cap-add=IPC_LOCK -e 'VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=myroot' -e 'VAULT_DEV_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8200' --net host vault:latest
```
**For WSL2 users:**
```bash
docker run --name jx-k3s-vault -d --cap-add=IPC_LOCK -e 'VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID=myroot' -e 'VAULT_DEV_LISTEN_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8200' -p 8200:8200 vault:latest
```

To verify if vault started properly use `docker logs jx-k3s-vault`.

Next enable kubernetes auth in vault.

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR='http://0.0.0.0:8200'
# you may want to set this at the end of the ~/.bashrc file or ~/.zshrc either to be accesible for all terminals you open like the way we did above
vault auth enable kubernetes
```
Note: If you get the error `Error enabling kubernetes auth: Post "https://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/sys/auth/kubernetes": http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client`, try the command `vault login myroot`.

#### Github

- Create a git bot user (different from your own personal user) e.g. https://github.com/join and generate a a personal access token, this will be used by Jenkins X to interact with git repositories. e.g. https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,read:user,read:org,user:email,write:repo_hook,delete_repo,admin:repo_hook
- This bot user needs to have write permission to write to any git repository used by Jenkins X. This can be done by adding the bot user to the git organisation level or individual repositories as a collaborator Add the new bot user to your Git Organisation, for now give it Owner permissions, we will reduce this to member permissions soon.

#### Jenkins-X
- Make sure you have installed [jx 3.x binary](https://jenkins-x.io/v3/admin/setup/jx3/) and put it on your `$PATH` as the `jx admin operator` will be used 

### Jenkins X v3 installation
- Generate a cluster git repository from the [jx3-k3s-vault](https://github.com/jx3-gitops-repositories/jx3-k3s-vault) template, by clicking [here](https://github.com/jx3-gitops-repositories/jx3-k3s-vault/generate)
- Edit the value of the vault url in the `jx-requirements.yaml` file.
  Replace with `"http://<replace with k3s node name>:8200"`
- Commit and push your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: set vault url"
git push origin main
```

- Set the GIT_USERNAME (bot username) and GIT_TOKEN (bot personal access token) env variable and run:

```bash
jx admin operator --username $GIT_USERNAME --token $GIT_TOKEN --url <url of the cluster git repo> --set "jxBootJobEnvVarSecrets.EXTERNAL_VAULT=\"true\"" --set "jxBootJobEnvVarSecrets.VAULT_ADDR=http://<replace with k3s node name>:8200"
```

> Note: The first job will fail as it cannot authenticate against vault.
> The errors will be of the form `error: failed to populate secrets: failed to create a secret manager for ExternalSecret`.
> Once the secret-infra namespace has been created, we can configure vault.
> If you get an error connecting to the cluster, try running `kubectl config view --raw >~/.kube/config` as well as checking the permissions/owner of `~/.kube/config`
### Vault configuration

Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) before running these commands.

Remember to run the following commands in a terminal where you have set the value of `VAULT_ADDR`

- Create a vault config

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR='http://0.0.0.0:8200'
export VAULT_HELM_SECRET_NAME=$(kubectl -n secret-infra get secrets --output=json | jq -r '.items[].metadata | select(.name|startswith("kubernetes-external-secrets-token-")).name')
export TOKEN_REVIEW_JWT=$(kubectl -n secret-infra get secret $VAULT_HELM_SECRET_NAME --output='go-template={{ .data.token }}' | base64 --decode)
export KUBE_CA_CERT=$(kubectl config view --raw --minify --flatten --output='jsonpath={.clusters[].cluster.certificate-authority-data}' | base64 --decode)
export KUBE_HOST=$(kubectl config view --raw --minify --flatten --output='jsonpath={.clusters[].cluster.server}')

# you may want to set this at the end of the ~/.bashrc file or ~/.zshrc either to be accesible for all terminals you open like the way we did above

vault write auth/kubernetes/config \
        token_reviewer_jwt="$TOKEN_REVIEW_JWT" \
        kubernetes_host="$KUBE_HOST" \
        kubernetes_ca_cert="$KUBE_CA_CERT" \
        disable_iss_validation=true
```

- Create a vault role:

```bash
vault write /auth/kubernetes/role/jx-vault bound_service_account_names='*' bound_service_account_namespaces=secret-infra token_policies=jx-policy token_no_default_policy=true disable_iss_validation=true
```

- Create a policy attached to vault role:

```bash
vault policy write jx-policy - <<EOF
path "secret/*" {
  capabilities = ["sudo", "create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
}
EOF
```

Once vault is configured, pull the changes commited to the cluster git repository by the bootjob, and push a dummy job

```bash
git pull
# Make a dummy change (change Readme file for example)
git add .
git commit -m "chore: dummy commit 1"
git push origin main
```

tail the logs of `jx-git-operator` pod in the `jx-git-operator` namespace.

```
not creating a Job in namespace jx-git-operator for repo jx-boot sha XXXXXX yet as there is an active job jx-boot-XXXXXXX
```

Kill that job.

```bash
kubectl delete job jx-boot-97dbb72f-4e4e-4b0e-8eb2-8908997b19f7 -n jx-git-operator
```

Once it's killed a new boot job will be triggered.
This job will create the secrets in vault which will be used by external secrets to create kubernetes secrets.

- To verify the job succeeded, run `jx admin log`
- To verfiy the secrets were created, run `kubectl get es -A` and `jx secret verify`
- If this didn't work try and repeat the steps but commit your dummy changes through github repository directly other than the `git push origin main` command
### Set up ingress and webhook

- Get the external IP of the traefik service (loadbalancer)

```bash
kubectl get svc -A | grep LoadBalancer
kube-system   traefik          LoadBalancer   <cluster-ip>    <external-ip>    80:31123/TCP,443:31783/TCP   40m
```

- Edit the jx-requirements.yaml file by editing the ingress domain:

```bash
# There may be some changes committed by the jx boot job
git pull
jx gitops requirements edit --domain <external-ip>.nip.io
```

- Next, download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/). Run this in a new terminal window/tab:

```bash
ngrok http 8080
```

- Once this tunnel is open, paste the ngrok url (without http and https) in the hook field in the helmfiles/jx/jxboot-helmfile-resources-values.yaml file in the cluster git repository.
- commit and push the changes.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: new ngrok ip"
git push origin main
```

- In another terminal run the following command to enable webhooks via ngrok

```bash
jx ns jx
kubectl port-forward svc/hook 8080:80
```

- Once the bootjob has succeeded, you should see:

```bash
HTTP Requests
-------------

POST /hook                     200 OK
```
