This guide will help you install, configure and use an observability stack in your Jenkins X cluster.

We selected the [Grafana](http://grafana.com/) stack because:

- it's [open-source](https://grafana.com/oss/)
- it has support for [logs](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/), [metrics](https://grafana.com/oss/prometheus/), and [distributed traces](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/)
- it has a low memory footprint, and a great Kubernetes integration

## Installation

Please follow the usual [getting started guide for boot and helm 3](/v3/admin/platform/) first.

The first step is to edit your main `helmfile.yaml` file located in the root directory of your development environment git repository, so that it references the `helmfiles/jx-observability/helmfile.yaml` file, such as:

```yaml
helmfiles:
- path: helmfiles/jx/helmfile.yaml
- path: helmfiles/jx-observability/helmfile.yaml
- path: helmfiles/tekton-pipelines/helmfile.yaml
...
```

The second step is to create the `helmfiles/jx-observability/helmfile.yaml` file, with the following content:

```yaml
namespace: jx-observability
repositories:
- name: jxgh
  url: https://jenkins-x-charts.github.io/repo
- name: grafana
  url: https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
- name: prometheus-community
  url: https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
releases:
- chart: jxgh/grafana-dashboard
  name: grafana-dashboard
- chart: grafana/loki
  name: loki
- chart: grafana/promtail
  name: promtail
- chart: grafana/tempo
  name: tempo
- chart: grafana/grafana
  name: grafana
- chart: prometheus-community/prometheus
  name: prometheus
```

Commit and push these changes, and after a few minutes you should see grafana, loki, promtail, tempo, and prometheus pods running in the `jx-observability` namespace:

```bash
$ kubectl get pod -n jx-observability
NAME                                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

### Who's who

- [Promtail](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/) collects the logs from all running containers
  - it is deployed as a daemonset on every node of the cluster so that it can read the Kubernetes log files
- [Loki](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/) ingests the logs - pushed by promtail - and exposes a query API
- [Tempo](https://grafana.com/docs/tempo/latest/) ingests the traces - pushed by the applications or an agent such as the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/) - and exposes a query API
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) (server) collects and ingests the metrics from the running pods
  - [Prometheus Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/alertmanager/) handles alerts - generated by Prometheus server, Loki or Grafana
  - [Prometheus Node Exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/) collects hardware- and kernel-related metrics
    - it is deployed as a daemonset on every node of the cluster
  - [Kube State Metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) collects metrics from the Kubernetes API
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/) is the UI that brings everything together
- [Grafana Dashboard](https://github.com/jenkins-x-charts/grafana-dashboard) is a Helm Chart that contains Grafana Dashboards for Jenkins X, stored in Kubernetes ConfigMaps

## Usage

Grafana is exposed through an ingress - you can retrieve its URL with the following command:

```bash
kubectl get ing -n jx-observability
```

The default credentials are stored in the `grafana` Kubernetes Secret:

- the default user is `admin`
- the default password has been auto-generated at installation time, you can retrieve it with the following command:

```bash
kubectl -n jx-observability get secret grafana --template='{{index .data "admin-password"}}' | base64 --decode
```

Once you are logged in, you can play with the pre-defined dashboards, or with the [Grafana Explorer](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/explore/).

This is an example of a pre-defined dashboard, for [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/), where we display on the same dashboard metrics collected by Prometheus (including the certificates expiration dates) and logs collected by Loki/Promtail:

## Configuration

The configuration is defined in "values files" stored in the Jenkins X Version Stream:

- [Grafana configuration](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx3-versions/tree/master/charts/grafana/grafana)
- [Loki configuration](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx3-versions/tree/master/charts/grafana/loki)
- [Promtail configuration](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx3-versions/tree/master/charts/grafana/promtail)
- [Tempo configuration](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx3-versions/tree/master/charts/grafana/tempo)
- [Prometheus configuration](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx3-versions/tree/master/charts/prometheus-community/prometheus)

If you want to change anything from the default configuration, you can either:

- submit a Pull Request if you believe this change is beneficial for everybody
- or create a new values file in your development environment git repository, in the `values` directory
  - for example, `values/grafana/values.yaml` for Grafana, or `values/prometheus/values.yaml` for Prometheus

## Next steps

Once the Grafana stack is installed and configured, you can:

- visualize pipelines traces from the [Jenkins X Pipelines Visualizer](/v3/develop/ui/dashboard/)
- install the [Continuous Delivery Indicators](/v3/admin/guides/observability/cd-indicators/) addon
- expose Prometheus metrics from your own applications
- export traces from your own applications, using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/)
- create Grafana dashboards for your applications
- contribute to the [Jenkins X Grafana Dashboards](https://github.com/jenkins-x-charts/grafana-dashboard)
