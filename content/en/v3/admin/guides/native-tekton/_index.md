As part of the efforts to upgrade Jenkins X's compatibility with more recent Kubernetes & Tekton versions we've made the
decision to fully migrate to native Tekton pipelines. This brings us inline with the latest version of Tekton;
and allows us to take advantage of features such as the Tekton Dashboard and whilst increasing the transparency of the 
pipeline mechanisms.
