## Infrastructure

If you have used one of the Jenkins X Terraform Git repositories to create and manage your cloud resources then you have two options.

### Terraform manual apply

If you are running the Terraform apply commands yourself then from your infrastructure Git repository run:
```
export TF_VAR_jx_bot_username=[your bot username]
export TF_VAR_jx_bot_token=[your bot token]
terraform get -update
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

### Terraform Cloud
If you are using [Terraform Cloud](https://www.terraform.io/) then from your infrastructure Git repository run:

```
terraform get -update
git commit -a -m 'chore: upgrade cloud infra'
git push
```
Terraform Cloud should trigger automatically and apply the updates, view the log in Terraform Cloud.
