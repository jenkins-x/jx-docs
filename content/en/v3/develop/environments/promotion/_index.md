When changes are merged to the main branch in the Jenkins X pipeline catalog a new versioned release is created (with a new image and helm chart). This new version is then promoted by creating Pull Requests on GitOps repositories.

## How it works

The release pipelines use the [jx promote --all](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-promote/blob/master/docs/cmd/jx-promote.md#jx-promote) command which creates Pull Requests on all Environments configured in your `jx-requirements.yml` file (see the [Configuration](/v3/develop/environments/config/)) 

* every environment which is defined in `jx-requirements.yml` as `promotionStrategy` **Auto** or **Manual** is included in a Pull Request to promote the new version to that environment

  * **Auto** means the Pull Request will automatically merge if its successful (the Pull Request pipeline succeeds)

  * **Manual** means the Pull Request is a draft and won't automatically merge. i.e. the Pull Request needs to be manually approved (comment `/approve`) and taken off hold (comment `/hold cancel`). 

* all local Environments in your `jx-requirements.yml` of the promotion kind **Auto** are promoted using a single Pull Request so that all the promotions automatically merge if the pull request pipeline validates successfully.

* you can define multiple local or remote Environments for different system / integration testing environments.


## Changing Promotion

If you want to disable promotion Pull Requests on an environment just remove the entry in `jx-requirements.yml` or configure the `promotionStrategy` to be **Never**

If you want your application to promote to different environments to the defaults for your cluster you can always [modify your pipeline](/v3/develop/pipelines/#editing-pipelines) and change the promote step to use different [jx promote](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-promote/blob/master/docs/cmd/jx-promote.md#jx-promote) arguments; e.g. pass in the explicit environments or repositories you want to promote to in the pipeline step.


## Synchronizing environments or namespaces

By default each release of each microservice creates a Pull Request to upgrade that specific microservice to a new version in each of your environments - e.g. `Staging` and `Production`.

When human approval is required in, say, `Production` you can end up with the `drift` between the 2 environments and want an easy way to bring them in sync.


The default with Jenkins X is for each new version of each microservice to be promoted immediately to `Staging`. You may want to test the combination of microservices together for a while beforethen choosing to promote changes to production and may want to do this in one atomic Pull Request and commit/merge.

If you wish to work in this way you can create a single Pull Request promoting all of the changes of apps between 2 environments or namespaces.

You can use the [jx updatebot sync](/v3/develop/reference/jx/updatebot/sync/) command to synchronise 2 environments or namespaces to reduce drift by creating a single Pull Request to add any missing applications or upgrade them.

```bash 
# synchronizes the apps in 2 of your environments (local or remote)
jx updatebot sync --source-env staging --target-env production
```

This works whether the environments are separate namespaces within the same kubernetes cluster or you are using [Multiple Cluster](/v3/admin/guides/multi-cluster/)

Note that if you are using [Multiple Clusters](/v3/admin/guides/multi-cluster/) make sure your terminal is connected to the development cluster before running [jx updatebot sync](/v3/develop/reference/jx/updatebot/sync/)
