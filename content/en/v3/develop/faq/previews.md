## When do Preview Environments get removed?

We have a background garbage collection job which removes Preview Environments after the Pull Request is closed/merged. You can run it any time you like via the [jx preview gc](/v3/develop/reference/jx/preview/gc/) command

```sh
jx preview gc
```

You can also view the current previews via  [jx preview get](/v3/develop/reference/jx/preview/get/):

```sh
jx preview get
```


and delete a preview by choosing one to delete via [jx preview destroy](/v3/develop/reference/jx/preview/destroy/):

```sh
jx preview destroy
```

## How do I access the preview namespace or URL?
             
After the [jx preview create](/v3/develop/reference/jx/preview/create) step in a pull request pipeline you can access a number of [preview environment variables](/v3/develop/environments/preview/#environment-variables).

For details see [how to add additional preview steps](/v3/develop/environments/preview/#additional-preview-steps)


## How do I add other services into a Preview?

see [how to add resources to your previews](/v3/develop/environments/preview/#adding-more-resources)
                           

## How do I configure Secrets in a Preview?

Previews are installed via `helmfile sync` unlike the [usual approach for promoted environments](/v3/develop/faq/general/#why-does-jenkins-x-use-helmfile-template) like `Dev`, `Staging` and `Production` as the changes have not yet been released.

This means the usual [conversion from Secret resources to ExternalSecrets](/v3/about/how-it-works/#secrets) is not enabled for previews.

So to add `Secret` resources into your preview namespace try one of the following:

* if you can use dynamically generated `Secret` values then just use the usual helm approach to creating `Secret` resources
* if you need configured Secrets to access external services then you can copy them from the `jx` namespace. We copy labelled secrets [by default in the preview helmfile.yaml](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx3-pipeline-catalog/blob/master/packs/javascript/preview/helmfile.yaml#L23-L31)
    * you just need to add the label: `secret.jenkins-x.io/replica-source=true` to your `Secret` in the `jx` namespace
    * see [how to add a new Secret](/v3/admin/setup/secrets/#create-a-new-secret)  
* you can add an `ExternalSecret resource` to your preview `helmfile.yaml`as a [nested chart like this](https://jenkins-x.io/v3/develop/apps/#adding-resources) which will then use [external secrets operator](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets) to populate the `Secret` resources from the external secret store.
* add a `Job`, init-container or helmfile hook in `preview/helmfile.yaml` to generate the `Secret` dynamically using whatever custom logic you prefer 


## How do I inject the Preview URL into other services?

The preview namespace and URL are [available as environment variables](/v3/develop/environments/preview/#environment-variables) after the preview has been created.

However if you want to pass in the preview URL to [other charts included in your preview](/v3/develop/environments/preview/#adding-more-resources) via the `preview/helmfile.yaml` file you can:

* use the service URL rather than ingress which is much simpler and does not depend on the namespace or domain. e.g. just use `http://my-app-name`
* add a `values.yaml.gotmpl` file for the chart to [configure its values](/v3/develop/apps/#customising-charts) you wish to inject the URL into and pass in whatever yaml is required to configure the preview URL using the following expression. The example below uses `someValue` as the key to specify the URL but use whatever yaml keys your chart expects: 

```yaml 
someValue:  "{{ requiredEnv "APP_NAME" }}-pr{{ requiredEnv "PULL_NUMBER" }}.{{ .Values.jxRequirements.ingress.domain }}"
```
