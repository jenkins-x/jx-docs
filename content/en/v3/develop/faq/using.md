## How do I list the apps that have been deployed?
 
You can see the helm charts that are installed along with their version, namespaces and any configuration values by looking at the `releases` section of your `helmfile.yaml` file in your cluster git repository.

You can browse all the kubernetes resources in each namespace using the canonical layout in the `config-root` folder. e.g. all charts are versioned in git as follows:

```bash 
config-root/
  namespaces/
   jx/
     lighthouse/
       lighthouse-webhooks-deploy.yaml    
```

You can see the above kubernetes resource, a `Deployment` with name `lighthouse-webhooks` in the namespace `jx` which comes from the `lighthouse` chart.

There could be some additional charts installed via Terraform for the [git operator](/v3/guides/operator/) and [health subsystem](/v3/guides/health/) which can be viewed via:

```bash 
helm list --all-namespaces
```                                                                                


## How do I use testcontainers?

If you want to use a container, such as a database, inside your pipeline so that you can run tests against your database inside your pipeline then use a [sidecar container in Tekton](https://tekton.dev/vault/pipelines-v0.16.3/tasks/#specifying-sidecars).

Here is [another example of a sidecar in a pipeline](https://tekton.dev/vault/pipelines-v0.16.3/tasks/#using-a-sidecar-in-a-task)

If you want to use a separate container inside a preview environment then add [charts or resources](/v3/develop/apps/#adding-charts) to the `preview/helmfile.yaml`
