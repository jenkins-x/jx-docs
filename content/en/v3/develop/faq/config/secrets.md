## How do I change the secret poll period in kubernetes external secrets?

Your cloud provider could charge per read of a secret and so a frequent poll of your secrets could cost $$$. You may want to tone down the poll period.

You can do this via the `POLLER_INTERVAL_MILLISECONDS` setting in the [kubernetes external secrets configuration](https://github.com/external-secrets/kubernetes-external-secrets/tree/master/charts/kubernetes-external-secrets#configuration)
