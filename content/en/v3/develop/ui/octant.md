As a general purpose console for working with Kubernetes, Jenkins X, Tekton and more resources we highly recommend [Octant](https://octant.dev/)

To run Octant with the Jenkins X plugins if you [have a recent jx binary](/docs/v3/guides/upgrade/#cli) run:

```bash 
jx ui
```

This will download the [octant](https://octant.dev/) binary and the [octant-jx](https://github.com/jenkins-x/octant-jx) plugin then startup  [Octant](https://octant.dev/) for you

### More Information

Please check out the [documentation on using Octant and Jenkins X](/docs/reference/components/ui/) to get started.
